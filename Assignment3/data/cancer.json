Here, we sought to investigate the presence of KIT genetic alterations in breast cancer (BC) and characterise the histological and genomic features of these tumours. A retrospective analysis of 5,575 BCs previously subjected to targeted sequencing using the FDA-authorised Memorial Sloan Kettering-Integrated Mutation Profiling of Actionable Targets (MSK-IMPACT) assay was performed to identify BCs with KIT alterations. A histological assessment of KIT-altered BCs was conducted, and their repertoire of genetic alterations was compared with that of BCs lacking KIT genetic alterations, matched for age, histological type, oestrogen receptor\/HER2 status and sample type. We identified 18 BCs (0.32%), including 9 primary and 9 metastatic BCs, with oncogenic\/likely oncogenic genetic alterations affecting KIT, including activating somatic mutations (n=4) or gene amplification (n=14). All KIT-altered BCs were of high histological grade, although no distinctive histological features were observed. When compared with BCs lacking KIT genetic alterations, no distinctive genetic features were identified. In two metastatic KIT-altered BCs in which the matched primary BC had also been analysed by MSK-IMPACT, the KIT mutations were found to be restricted to the metastatic samples, suggesting that they were late events in the evolution of these cancers. KIT genetic alterations are vanishingly rare in BC. KIT-altered BCs are of high grade but lack distinctive histological features. Genetic alterations in KIT might be late events in the evolution and\/or progression of BC.","query":"cancer"},"36323504":{"ArticleTitle":"Picking up microbial clues in early-onset colorectal cancer.","AbstractText":"","query":"cancer"},"36323475":{"ArticleTitle":"Risk factors for workplace bullying, severe psychological distress and suicidal ideation during the COVID-19 pandemic among the general working population in Japan: a large-scale cross-sectional study.","AbstractText":"To investigate the risk factors for workplace bullying and mental health outcomes among workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. A cross-sectional study. A nationwide online survey was conducted from August to September 2020 in Japan. 16&#8201;384 workers (men: n=9565; women: n=6789). Workplace bullying was measured by one item from the Brief Job Stress Questionnaire; severe psychological distress according to the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (&#8805;13) and suicidal ideation by one item. Prevalence ratios were calculated by modified Poisson regression analyses adjusting for potential confounders such as gender, age, occupational characteristics and a prior history of depression. Overall, 15% of workers experienced workplace bullying, 9% had severe psychological distress and 12% had suicidal ideation during the second and third wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan. The results of this study showed men, executives, managers and permanent employees had a higher risk of bullying than women or part-time workers. Increased physical and psychological demands were common risk factors for bullying, severe psychological distress and suicidal ideation. Starting to work from home was a significant predictor for adverse mental health outcomes but a preventive factor against workplace bullying. The results of this study showed different high-risk groups for bullying or mental health during the pandemic. Any intervention to decrease workplace bullying or mental health problems should focus not only on previously reported vulnerable workers but also workers who have experienced a change in work style or job demands.","query":"cancer"},"36323457":{"ArticleTitle":"Post-transplant diabetes mellitus and renal cell cancer after renal transplantation.","AbstractText":"Diabetes is a risk factor for cancer in the general population.

Reasons for treatment failure are poorly understood. CARs simultaneously targeting two antigens may represent an alternative. Here, we (1) designed and characterized novel A proliferation inducing ligand (APRIL) based dual-antigen targeting CARs, and (2) investigated mechanisms of resistance to CAR T cells with three different BCMA-binding moieties (APRIL, single-chain-variable-fragment, heavy-chain-only). Three new APRIL-CARs were designed and characterized. Human APRIL-CAR T cells were evaluated for their cytotoxic function in vitro and in vivo, for their polyfunctionality, immune synapse formation, memory, exhaustion phenotype and tonic signaling activity. To investigate resistance mechanisms, we analyzed BCMA levels and cellular localization and quantified CAR T cell-target cell interactions by live microscopy. Impact on pathway activation and tumor cell proliferation was assessed in vitro and in vivo. APRIL-CAR T cells in a trimeric ligand binding conformation conferred fast but not sustained antitumor responses in vivo in mouse xenograft models. In vitro trimer-BB&#950; CAR T cells were more polyfunctional and formed stronger immune synapses than monomer-BB&#950; CAR T cells. After CAR T cell-myeloma cell contact, BCMA was rapidly downmodulated on target cells with all evaluated binding moieties. CAR T cells acquired BCMA by trogocytosis, and BCMA on MM cells was rapidly internalized. Since BCMA can be re-expressed during progression and persisting CAR T cells may not protect patients from relapse, we investigated whether non-functional CAR T cells play a role in tumor progression. While CAR T cell-MM cell interactions activated BCMA pathway, we did not find enhanced tumor growth in vitro or in vivo. Antitumor responses with APRIL-CAR T cells were fast but not sustained. Rapid BCMA downmodulation occurred independently of whether an APRIL or antibody-based binding moiety was used. BCMA internalization mostly contributed to this effect, but trogocytosis by CAR T cells was also observed. Our study sheds light on the mechanisms underlying CAR T cell failure in MM when targeting BCMA and can inform the development of improved treatment strategies.","query":"cancer"},"36323435":{"ArticleTitle":"Virtual clinical trials of anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 immunotherapy in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma using a quantitative systems pharmacology model.","AbstractText":"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common form of primary liver cancer and is the third-leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Most patients with HCC are diagnosed at an advanced stage, and the median survival for patients with advanced HCC treated with modern systemic therapy is less than 2 years. This leaves the advanced stage patients with limited treatment options. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) targeting programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) or its ligand, are widely used in the treatment of HCC and are associated with durable responses in a subset of patients. ICIs targeting cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) also have clinical activity in HCC. Combination therapy of nivolumab (anti-PD-1) and ipilimumab (anti-CTLA-4) is the first treatment option for HCC to be approved by Food and Drug Administration that targets more than one immune checkpoints. In this study, we used the framework of quantitative systems pharmacology (QSP) to perform a virtual clinical trial for nivolumab and ipilimumab in HCC patients. Our model incorporates detailed biological mechanisms of interactions of immune cells and cancer cells leading to antitumor response. To conduct virtual clinical trial, we generate virtual patient from a cohort of 5,000 proposed patients by extending recent algorithms from literature. The model was calibrated using the data of the clinical trial CheckMate 040 (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01658878). Retrospective analyses were performed for different immune checkpoint therapies as performed in CheckMate 040. Using machine learning approach, we predict the importance of potential biomarkers for immune blockade therapies. This is the first QSP model for HCC with ICIs and the predictions are consistent with clinically observed outcomes. This study demonstrates that using a mechanistic understanding of the underlying pathophysiology, QSP models can facilitate patient selection and design clinical trials with improved success.","query":"cancer"},"36323434":{"ArticleTitle":"Intravenous administration of viral vectors expressing prostate cancer antigens enhances the magnitude and functionality of CD8+ T cell responses.","AbstractText":"The use of immunotherapeutic vaccination in prostate cancer is a promising approach that likely requires the induction of functional, cytotoxic T cells . The experimental approach described here uses a well-studied adenovirus-poxvirus heterologous prime-boost regimen, in which the vectors encode a combination of prostate cancer antigens, with the booster dose delivered by either the intravenous or intramuscular (IM) route. This prime-boost regimen was investigated for antigen-specific CD8+ T&#8201;cell induction. The coding sequences for four antigens expressed in prostate cancer, 5T4, PSA, PAP, and STEAP1, were inserted into replication-incompetent chimpanzee adenovirus Oxford 1 (ChAdOx1) and into replication-deficient modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA). In four strains of mice, ChAdOx1 prime was delivered intramuscularly, with an MVA boost delivered by either IM or intravenous routes. Immune responses were measured in splenocytes using ELISpot, multiparameter flow cytometry, and a targeted in vivo killing assay. The prime-boost regimen was highly immunogenic, with intravenous administration of the boost resulting in a sixfold increase in the magnitude of antigen-specific T cells induced and increased in vivo killing relative to the intramuscular boosting route. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA)-specific responses were dominant in all mouse strains studied (C57BL\/6, BALBc, CD-1 and HLA-A2 transgenic). This quadrivalent immunotherapeutic approach using four antigens expressed in prostate cancer induced high magnitude, functional CD8+ T cells in murine models. The data suggest that comparing the intravenous versus intramuscular boosting routes is worthy of investigation in humans.","query":"cancer"},"36323433":{"ArticleTitle":"Identification of natural product 3, 5-diiodotyrosine as APOBEC3B inhibitor to prevent somatic mutation accumulation and cancer progression.","AbstractText":"The development of cancer is largely dependent on the accumulation of somatic mutations, indicating the potential to develop cancer chemoprevention agents targeting mutation drivers. However, ideal cancer chemoprevention agents that can effectively inhibit the mutation drivers have not been identified yet. The somatic mutation signatures and expression analyses of APOBEC3B were performed in patient with pan-cancer. The computer-aided screening and skeleton-based searching were performed to identify natural products that can inhibit the activity of APOBEC3B. 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide (4-NQO)-induced spontaneous esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) and azoxymethane\/dextran sulfate sodium (AOM\/DSS)-induced spontaneous colon cancer mouse models were conducted to investigate the influences of APOBEC3B inhibitor on the prevention of somatic mutation accumulation and cancer progression. Here, we discovered that the cytidine deaminase APOBEC3B correlated somatic mutations were widely observed in a variety of cancers, and its overexpression indicated poor survival. SMC247 (3, 5-diiodotyrosine), as a source of kelp iodine without side effects, could strongly bind APOBEC3B (KD=65&#8201;nM) and effectively inhibit its deaminase activity (IC50=1.69&#8201;&#181;M). Interestingly, 3, 5-diiodotyrosine could significantly reduce the clusters of mutations, prevent the precancerous lesion progression, and prolong the survival in 4-NQO-induced spontaneous ESCC and AOM\/DSS-induced spontaneous colon cancer mouse models. Furthermore, 3, 5-diiodotyrosine could reduce colitis, increase the proportion and function of T lymphocytes via IL-15 in tumor microenvironment.

CD40-targeting therapies designed to enhance antigen presentation, generate new tumor-specific T cells, and activate tumor-infiltrating myeloid cells to remodel the tumor microenvironment, represent a promising opportunity to meet this need. In this study, we present the first in vivo data supporting a role for tumor-associated antigen (TAA)-mediated uptake and cross-presentation of tumor antigens to enhance tumor-specific T-cell priming using CD40&#215;TAA bispecific antibodies, a concept we named Neo-X-Prime. Bispecific antibodies targeting CD40 and either of two cell-surface expressed TAA, carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 5 (CEA) or epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM), were developed in a tetravalent format. TAA-conditional CD40 agonism, activation of tumor-infiltrating immune cells, antitumor efficacy and the role of delivery of tumor-derived material such as extracellular vesicles, tumor debris and exosomes by the CD40&#215;TAA bispecific antibodies were demonstrated in vitro using primary human and murine cells and in vivo using human CD40 transgenic mice with different tumor models. The results showed that the CD40&#215;TAA bispecific antibodies induced TAA-conditional CD40 activation both in vitro and in vivo. Further, it was demonstrated in vitro that they induced clustering of tumor debris and CD40-expressing cells in a dose-dependent manner and superior T-cell priming when added to dendritic cells (DC), ovalbumin (OVA)-specific T cells and OVA-containing tumor debris or exosomes. The antitumor activity of the Neo-X-Prime bispecific antibodies was demonstrated to be significantly superior to the monospecific CD40 antibody, and the resulting T-cell dependent antitumor immunity was directed to tumor antigens other than the TAA used for targeting (EpCAM). The data presented herein support the hypothesis that CD40&#215;TAA bispecific antibodies can engage tumor-derived vesicles containing tumor neoantigens to myeloid cells such as DCs resulting in an improved DC-mediated cross-priming of tumor-specific CD8+ T cells. Thus, this principle may offer therapeutics strategies to enhance tumor-specific T-cell immunity and associated clinical benefit in indications characterized by poor T-cell infiltration or deficiencies in T-cell priming.","query":"cancer"},"36323430":{"ArticleTitle":"Immune-based biomarker accurately predicts response to imiquimod immunotherapy in cervical high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions.","AbstractText":"The complete response rate of cervical high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (cHSIL) patients to imiquimod immunotherapy is approximately 60%. Consequently, many patients are exposed to unnecessary adverse effects of imiquimod. On the other hand, conventional surgical large loop excision therapy is associated with increased risk of premature births in subsequent pregnancies. An in-depth analysis of the cHSIL immune microenvironment was performed in order to identify and develop a predictive biomarker for response to imiquimod, to maximize therapy efficacy and to avoid adverse effects in patients unlikely to respond. Biopsies of 35 cHSIL patients, before and 10 weeks on imiquimod treatment, were analyzed by two multispectral seven-color immunofluorescence panels for T cell and myeloid cell composition in relation to treatment response. Based on these results a simplified immunohistochemical detection protocol was developed. Samples were scanned with the Vectra multispectral imaging system and cells were automatically identified using machine learning. The immune microenvironment of complete responders (CR) is characterized by a strong and coordinated infiltration by T helper cells (activated PD1+\/type 1 Tbet+), M1-like macrophages (CD68+CD163-) and dendritic cells (CD11c+) prior to imiquimod. The lesions of non-responders (NRs) displayed a high infiltration by CD3+FOXP3+ regulatory T cells. At 10 weeks on imiquimod, a strong influx of intraepithelial and stromal CD4+ T cells was observed in CR but not NR patients. A steep decrease in macrophages occurred both in CR and NR patients, leveling the pre-existing differences in myeloid cell composition between the two groups. Based on the pre-existing immune composition differences, the sum of intraepithelial CD4 T cell, macrophage and dendritic cell counts was used to develop a quantitative simplified one color immunohistochemical biomarker, the CHSIL immune biomarker for imiquimod (CIBI), which can be automatically and unbiasedly quantified and has an excellent predictive capacity (receiver operating characteristic area under the curve 0.95, p<0.0001). The capacity of cHSIL patients to respond to imiquimod is associated with a pre-existing coordinated local immune process, fostering an imiquimod-mediated increase in local T cell infiltration. The CIBI immunohistochemical biomarker has strong potential to select cHSIL patients with a high likelihood to experience a complete response to imiquimod immunotherapy.","query":"cancer"},"36323417":{"ArticleTitle":"Risk of serious COVID-19 outcomes among adults and children with moderate-to-severe asthma: a systematic review and meta-analysis.","AbstractText":"The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation in the United Kingdom requested an evidence synthesis to investigate the relationship between asthma and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outcomes.

Other methods, such as next-generation short read sequencing or PCR assays, are limited in their capabilities to detect or characterize structural variants. However, the existing software for nanopore sequencing data analysis still reports incomplete variant sets, which also contain erroneous calls, a considerable obstacle for the molecular diagnosis or accurate genotyping of populations. We compared multiple factors affecting variant calling, such as reference genome version, aligner (minimap2, NGMLR, and lra) choice, and variant caller combinations (Sniffles, CuteSV, SVIM, and NanoVar), to find the optimal group of tools for calling large (>50 kb) deletions and duplications, using data from seven patients exhibiting gross gene defects on SERPINC1 and from a reference variant set as the control. The goal was to obtain the most complete, yet reasonably specific group of large variants using a single cell of PromethION sequencing, which yielded lower depth coverage than short-read sequencing. We also used a custom method for the statistical analysis of the coverage value to refine the resulting datasets. We found that for large deletions and duplications (>50 kb), the existing software performed worse than for smaller ones, in terms of both sensitivity and specificity, and newer tools had not improved this.

For this purpose, we used a murine model of human papilloma virus-related head and neck cancer paired with a curative regimen of cisplatin-based chemoradiation in male C57BL\/6J mice. Fatigue-like behavior was assessed by measuring variations in voluntary wheel running using a longitudinal design. Treatment robustly decreased voluntary wheel running, and this effect persisted for more than a month posttreatment. However, when wheels were removed, to minimize treatment-related fatigue, mice showed a more rapid return to baseline running levels. We confirmed that the delayed recovery observed in mice with continual wheel access was not due to increased treatment-related toxicity, in fact running attenuated cisplatin-induced kidney toxicity. Finally, we demonstrated that re-exposure to a treatment-related olfactory cue acutely re-instated fatigue.

Many clinical practice guidelines provide guidance for prevention and treatment; however, there are no specific recommendations for women. This is unfortunate because the proportion of women with breast- and gynecological cancers is high among patients with cancer-associated VTE. Thromboembolism often heralds cancer progression and poor prognosis and should-besides adequate anticoagulant management-also prompt reassessment and, if necessary, changes in cancer treatment. Recently, the new class of direct-acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs) has started to replace low-molecular-weight heparin as standard thromboprophylaxis and therapy in cancer patients. They are very effective, but they also carry a relevant risk of bleeding. Therefore, despite their ease of use, not every tumor patient qualifies for a DOAC, and this is especially true for gynecological tumor patients. Each prescription must be weighed individually. This review addresses specific aspects of VTE prophylaxis and management in women with cancer. Every physician who treats breast and gynecological cancers should be familiar with prophylaxis, diagnosis, and therapy of cancer-associated VTE. At the same time, patients should be informed by their physician what symptoms to look for and whom to contact if these symptoms occur, even outside of office hours and on weekends.","query":"cancer"},"36323268":{"ArticleTitle":"Training digital natives to transform healthcare: a 5-tiered approach for integrating clinical informatics into undergraduate medical education.","AbstractText":"Expansive growth in the use of health information technology (HIT) has dramatically altered medicine without translating to fully realized improvements in healthcare delivery.

Inappropriate pathway activation is implicated in the pathogenesis of ribosomopathies, while drugs selectively activating the pathway are in trials for cancer. Despite this, the molecular mechanism(s) regulating this process are poorly understood. Using genome-wide loss-of-function screens, we demonstrate the ribosome biogenesis axis as the most potent class of genes whose disruption stabilizes p53. Mechanistically, we identify genes critical for regulation of this pathway, including HEATR3. By selectively disabling the nucleolar surveillance pathway, we demonstrate that it is essential for the ability of all nuclear-acting stresses, including DNA damage, to induce p53 accumulation. Our data support a paradigm whereby the nucleolar surveillance pathway is the central integrator of stresses that regulate nuclear p53 abundance, ensuring that ribosome biogenesis is hardwired to cellular proliferative capacity.","query":"cancer"},"36323258":{"ArticleTitle":"Mobilizing phospholipids on tumor plasma membrane implicates phosphatidylserine externalization blockade for cancer immunotherapy.","AbstractText":"In \"healthy\" tumor cells, phosphatidylserine (PS) is predominately localized in the inner plasma membrane leaflet.

Integrating epigenomics, transcriptomics, and metabolic analyses with functional perturbation, we show that the tumor suppressor p53 preserves genomic integrity by empowering adequate levels of the universal methyl donor S-adenosylmethionine (SAM). In p53-deficient cells, perturbation of DNA methylation promotes derepression of heterochromatin, massive loss of histone H3-lysine 9 methylation, and consequent upregulation of satellite RNAs that triggers R-loop-associated replication stress and chromosomal aberrations. In p53-deficient cells, the inadequate SAM level underlies the inability to respond to perturbation because exogenous reintroduction of SAM represses satellite elements and restores the ability to cope with stress. Mechanistically, p53 transcriptionally controls genes involved in one-carbon metabolism, including Slc43a2, the methionine uptake transporter that is critical for SAM synthesis. Supported by clinical data, our findings shed light on the role of p53-mediated metabolism in preventing unscheduled R-loop-associated genomic instability.","query":"cancer"},"36323248":{"ArticleTitle":"Multi-omic profiling reveals the ataxia protein sacsin is required for integrin trafficking and synaptic organization.","AbstractText":"Autosomal recessive spastic ataxia of Charlevoix-Saguenay (ARSACS) is a childhood-onset cerebellar ataxia caused by mutations in SACS, which encodes the protein sacsin.

It is unclear why the loss of sacsin causes these deficits or why they manifest as cerebellar ataxia. Here, we perform multi-omic profiling in sacsin knockout (KO) cells and identify alterations in microtubule dynamics and mislocalization of focal adhesion (FA) proteins, including multiple integrins. Deficits in FA structure, signaling, and function can be rescued by targeting PTEN, a negative regulator of FA signaling. ARSACS mice possess mislocalization of ITGA1 in Purkinje neurons and synaptic disorganization in the deep cerebellar nucleus (DCN).

Here we show that the Rb\/E2F axis functions by linking the cell-cycle machinery to pivotal regulators of NSC fate. Deletion of Rb family proteins results in activation of NSCs, inducing a transcriptomic transition toward activation. Deletion of their target activator E2Fs1\/3 results in intractable quiescence and cessation of neurogenesis. We show that the Rb\/E2F axis mediates these fate transitions through regulation of factors essential for NSC function, including REST and ASCL1.

Limitations in current experimental methodology have prevented proper elucidation of the thermochemical processes inside the tissue during TCA. Nevertheless, the computational TCA framework developed recently by Mak et&#160;al. [Mak et&#160;al., Computers in Biology and Medicine, 2022, 145:105494] has opened new avenues in the development of TCA. Specifically, a recommended safe dosage is imperative in driving TCA research beyond the conceptual stage. The aforesaid computational TCA framework for sequential injection was applied and adapted to simulate TCA with simultaneous injection of acid and base at equimolar and equivolume. The developed framework, which describes the flow of acid and base, their neutralisation, the rise in tissue temperature and the formation of thermal damage, was solved numerically using the finite element method. The framework will be used to investigate the effects of injection rate, reagent concentration, volume and type (weak\/strong acid-base combination) on temperature rise and thermal coagulation formation. A higher injection rate resulted in higher temperature rise and larger thermal coagulation. Reagent concentration of 7500&#160;mol\/m3 was found to be optimum in producing considerable thermal coagulation without the risk of tissue overheating. Thermal coagulation volume was found to be consistently larger than the total volume of acid and base injected into the tissue, which is beneficial as it reduces the risk of chemical burn injury. Three multivariate second-order polynomials that express the targeted coagulation volume as functions of injection rate and reagent volume, for the weak-weak, weak-strong and strong-strong acid-base combinations were also derived based on the simulated data. A guideline for a safe and effective implementation of TCA with simultaneous injection of acid and base was recommended based on the numerical results of the computational model developed. The guideline correlates the coagulation volume with the reagent volume and injection rate, and may be used by clinicians in determining the safe dosage of reagents and optimum injection rate to achieve a desired thermal coagulation volume during TCA.","query":"cancer"},"36323171":{"ArticleTitle":"Trends in age and sex-specific prevalence of cancer and cancer subtypes in acute ischemic stroke from 2007-2019.","AbstractText":"To describe age and sex-specific prevalence of cancer in acute ischemic stroke (AIS) hospitalizations in the United States over the last decade.

Admissions with primary central nervous system cancers were excluded. Joinpoint regression was used to compute the average annualized percentage change (AAPC) in cancer prevalence over time. Across the study period, 12.7% of AIS admissions had previous\/active cancer, while 4.4% had active cancer. Of these, 18.8% were hematologic cancers, 47.2% were solid cancers without metastasis and 34.0% were metastatic cancers of any type. Age-adjusted active cancer prevalence differed by sex (males:4.8%; females:4.0%) and increased with age up to age 70-79 years (30-39 years 1.4%; 70-79 years:5.7%). Amongst cancer admissions, lung (18.7%) and prostate (17.8%) were the most common solid cancers in men, while lung (19.6%) and breast (13.7%) were the most prevalent in women.

This study aimed to evaluate the clinical benefits and risks of pembrolizumab measured by quality-adjusted survival in the trial population. The study used data from the final analysis of KN355. The Quality-adjusted Time Without Symptoms of disease progression or Toxicity of treatment (Q-TWiST) analysis was used to compare treatments of pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone. Patients' survival time was partitioned into three health states - toxicity before disease progression (TOX), time without symptoms or toxicity before disease progression (TWiST), and relapse (REL). Utilities for these health states were estimated using EuroQol-5 Dimensions, 3 Levels (EQ-5D-3L) data collected in KN355. Q-TWiST was derived as the utility-weighted sum of the mean health state durations. Patients randomised to pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy had 3.7 months greater Q-TWiST (relative gain of 18%; P&#160;=&#160;0.003) compared to those randomised to chemotherapy at the median follow-up of 44 months, and 4.3 months greater Q-TWiST (relative gain of 20%; P&#160;=&#160;0.004) at the maximum follow-up of 52 months.

This, together with further efforts to optimise next generation medicines, results in novel innovative products in development pipelines. In the context of global regulatory development requirements for these growing pipelines of innovative products (e.g. US RACE for children Act), it is an increasing challenge to complete development efforts in paediatric oncology, a therapeutic area of rare and life-threatening diseases with high unmet needs. Regulators recognise feasibility challenges of the regulatory obligations in this context. Here, we explain the EU regulatory decision making strategy applied to paediatric oncology, which aims fostering evidence generation to support developments based on needs and robust science. Because there is a plethora of products under development within given classes of or within cancer types, priorities need to be identified and updated as evidence evolves. This also includes identifying the need for third or fourth generation products to secure focused and accelerated drug development. An agreed PIP, as a plan, is a living document which can be modified in light of new evidence. For this to be successful, input from the various relevant stakeholders, i.e. patients\/parents, clinicians and investigators is required.

The mean of the three lowest country-specific incidence (excluding rates of zero) was defined as the attainable rate for each combination of cancer site, sex, and age group. The number and proportion of avoidable cancer cases was calculated as the difference between the country-specific and attainable incidence rates. Approximately, 697,000 cancer cases (33%) of all cases in men, and 837,000 (44%) in women were potentially avoidable. Lung, colorectal, and female breast cancer contributed the largest avoidable burden from cancer, with a combined 790,000 cases, followed by mesothelioma, melanoma of the skin, laryngeal, and oesophageal cancer as major contributors. Large geographical variations were found in the estimated proportion of avoidable cancer cases by sex.

Cancer cells rarely develop in denervated organs, and denervation affects tumorigenesis, in vivo and in humans. Axonogenesis occurs to supply the new malignant epithelial growth with nerves. Neurogenesis happens later, first in ganglia around organs or the spinal column and subsequently through recruitment of neuroblasts from the central nervous system. The hallmark of this stage is regulation of homeostasis and energetic metabolism. Perineural invasion is the most efficient interaction between cancer cells and nerves. The hallmark of this stage is increased proliferation and decreased apoptosis. Finally, carcinoma cells transdifferentiate into a neuronal profile in search of neural independence. The latter is the last stage in neuroepithelial interactions. Treatments for cancer must address the biology of neural regulation of cancer.

However, the data remain limited, particularly in Western populations, and are often contradictory. In this study, the prognostic value of positive SOX9 immunohistochemistry was compared with that of more established markers EpCAM and K19 in a large cohort (n=216) of North American patients. The independent HCC cohort in The Cancer Gene Atlas (n=360) was utilized to validate our findings. Finally, molecular signatures associated with SOX9-high HCC were determined. We found that the expression of SOX9, but not EpCAM or K19, was associated with worse overall survival and disease-free survival (DFS) and was an independent prognostic factor for DFS in our North American cohort, in which hepatitis C infection was the most common underlying etiology. High SOX9 mRNA level, but not increased expression of EpCAM mRNA or K19 mRNA, was also associated with worse DFS and was an independent prognostic factor for DFS in The Cancer Gene Atlas cohort. This group had underlying causes, including an increased incidence of hepatitis B, significantly different from our initial cohort. High SOX9 mRNA level is associated with molecular pathways important in HCC pathogenesis. Increased SOX9 expression is clinically and biologically relevant for HCC arising in patients with a variety of underlying etiologies. Immunohistochemistry for SOX9 is a reliable proxy for increased SOX9 mRNA and can be used to predict prognosis in HCC cases.","query":"cancer"},"36322977":{"ArticleTitle":"Managing the impact of inter-method bias of prostate specific antigen assays on biopsy referral: the key to move towards precision health in prostate cancer management.","AbstractText":"We assessed the inter-method bias of total (tPSA) and free (fPSA) prostate-specific antigen (PSA) immunoassays to establish if tPSA-based risk thresholds for advanced prostate cancer (PCa), obtained from one method (Roche) can be converted into the corresponding concentrations assayed by other methods. Then we evaluated the impact of the bias of tPSA and fPSA on the&#160;estimation of the %f\/tPSA ratio and performed a re-calibration of the proposed thresholds for the %f\/tPSA ratio according to the assay used. tPSA and fPSA were measured in 135 and 137 serum samples, respectively by Abbott Alinity i, Beckman Access Dxl, Roche Cobas e801, and Siemens Atellica IM&#160;analytical platforms. Scatterplots, Bland-Altman diagrams, Passing-Bablok (PB) were used to inspect and estimate the systematic and proportional bias between the methods.

To construct a correction coefficient for converting the %f\/tPSA ratio from one method to the other, PB and non-parametric boostrapping were used. The inter-method bias is not constant but strictly linear allowing the conversion of PSA results obtained from Roche into the other assays, which underestimate tPSA vs. Roche.

A complement C1Q+ macrophage-like leukemia subset which is enriched within cutis and existed in BM prior to EMI manifestations was identified and further verified in multiple AML patients. Genomic and transcriptional profiling disclosed mutation and gene expression signatures of EMI patients that expressed high level of C1Q. RNA-sequencing and quantitative proteomics analysis revealed expression dynamics of C1Q from primary to relapse. Univariate and multivariate analysis demonstrated adverse prognosis significance of C1Q expression. Mechanistically, C1Q expression, which was modulated by transcription factor MAFB, endowed leukemia cells with tissue-infiltration ability which could establish prominent cutaneous or gastrointestinal EMI nodules in patient-derived xenograft (PDX) and cell line-derived xenograft (CDX) models. Fibroblasts attracted migration of the C1Q+ leukemia cells through C1Q-gC1QR recognition and subsequent stimulation of TGF-&#946;1.

As their evolution is determined by factors that enable certain cellular subsets to outcompete others, techniques that resolve cellular heterogeneity at the single-cell level are ideally placed to provide new insights into MPN biology. With these insights comes the potential to uncover new approaches to predict the clinical course and treat these cancers, ultimately improving outcomes for patients. MPNs present a particularly tractable model of cancer evolution, as most patients present in an early disease phase and only a small proportion progress to aggressive disease. Therefore, it is not surprising that many of the groundbreaking technological advances in single-cell omics have been pioneered by their application in MPNs.

We generated a rhesus macaque (RM) FPDMM competitive repopulation model using CRISPR\/Cas9 NHEJ editing in the RUNX1 gene and the AAVS1 safe-harbor control locus. We transplanted mixed populations of edited autologous hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) and tracked mutation allele frequencies in blood cells.

While all cell types secrete inactive, latent TGF-b1, only a few activate the cytokine via cell type-specific mechanisms. The cellular source of the active TGF-b1 implicated in PMF is not known. Transmembrane protein GARP binds and activates latent TGF-b1 on the surface of regulatory T lymphocytes (Tregs) and MKs or platelets. Here, we found increased expression of GARP in BM and spleen of mice undergoing PMF and tested the therapeutic potential of a monoclonal antibody that blocks TGF-b1 activation by GARP-expressing cells.

Using mice carrying a genetic deletion of Garp in either Tregs or MKs, we found that the therapeutic effects of GARP:TGF-b1 blockade in PMF imply targeting GARP on Tregs. These therapeutic effects, accompanied by increased IFN-g signals in the spleen, were lost upon CD8 T cell depletion.

We tested excerno by simulating mutations across all 60-baseline mutational signatures from the Catalog of Somatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC) and combining them with mutations following the FFPE mutational signature. The sensitivity and specificity of excerno are adversely affected by the cosine similarity between the baseline and FFPE signatures (cosFFPE).

Participants were disease-free breast cancer survivors age 20-49 years who were randomly assigned to the smartphone-based intervention or waitlist control. Both groups received treatment as usual. The control group could access the smartphone apps during weeks 8-24. The intervention comprised smartphone problem-solving therapy and behavioral activation apps. The primary end point was the Concerns About Recurrence Scale at week 8. Secondary outcomes included the Fear of Cancer Recurrence Inventory-Short Form (FCRI-SF), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), the Short-form Supportive Care Needs Survey (SCNS-SF34), and the Posttraumatic Growth Inventory at weeks 8 and 24 (trial registration: UMIN-CTR: UMIN000031140). The intervention group included 223 participants, and the control group included 224 participants. Primary outcome data were obtained for 444 participants, and 213 participants in the intervention arm completed the week 24 assessment. The intervention group had statistically greater improvements than controls at week 8 on the Concerns About Recurrence Scale (difference -1.39; 95% CI, -1.93 to -0.85; P < .001), FCRI-SF (difference -1.65; 95% CI, -2.41 to -0.89; P < .001), HADS depression (difference -0.49; 95% CI, -0.98 to 0; P < .05), and SCNS-SF34 psychological domain (difference -1.49; 95% CI, -2.67 to -0.32; P < .05). These scores at week 24 were not statistically significant compared with week 8 although the HADS depression score at week 24 was significantly reduced (P = .03). Novel smartphone psychotherapy offers a promising way to reduce FCR given the large number of survivors and a limited number of therapists to competently conduct psychotherapy.","query":"cancer"},"36322880":{"ArticleTitle":"The Impact of Intensified CNS-Directed Therapy on Neurocognitive Outcomes in Survivors of Childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Treated Without Cranial Irradiation.","AbstractText":"Findings from St Jude Total Therapy Study 16 (Total 16) showed early intensification of triple intrathecal therapy (ITT) improved CNS disease control for children with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) at the greatest risk of CNS relapse.

Caregiver ratings of patient functioning showed elevated risk for problems in attention (P = .0173), executive function (P = .0001), and adaptive skills (P = .0001). Among the low-risk treatment group, there were no significant differences between patients treated with or without intensified ITT (all P's >.10).

In the standard-to-high risk group, females treated with intensified ITT had lower working memory scores. Public insurance status was associated with worse neurocognitive outcomes in both treatment groups. Standard-to-high risk patients treated with intensified ITT are at moderately increased risk for neurocognitive problems. The findings suggest a threshold effect for ITT exposure, which can inform the design of future clinical trials and approaches to neurocognitive monitoring and intervention.","query":"cancer"},"36322879":{"ArticleTitle":"Targeted Wolfram-Doped Polypyrrole for Photonic Hyperthermia-Synergized Radiotherapy.","AbstractText":"Single ionizing radiation at a tolerable dose is ineffectual in eliminating malignancies but readily generates harmful effects on surrounding normal tissues.

In comparison with traditional polypyrrole without noble metal doping, the innovative introduction of WCl6 not only successfully launched the polymerization of a pyrrole monomer but also endowed WPPy with additional radiosensitization. More importantly, after further decoration with an active targeted component (SP94 polypeptide), the obtained WPPy@SP94 significantly increased tumor internalization and accumulation in vitro and in vivo and induced obvious DNA damage as well as robust ROS generation under X-ray irradiation, which meanwhile synergized with strong photonic hyperthermia to effectively inhibit tumor growth by single drug injection. Moreover, such biocompatible WPPy@SP94 showed negligible adverse effects on normal cells and tissues.

We conducted an open-label, multicenter, randomized, phase 3 trial involving patients 2 to 21 years of age with previously untreated Hodgkin's lymphoma of stage IIB with bulk tumor or stage IIIB, IVA, or IVB. Patients were assigned to receive five 21-day cycles of brentuximab vedotin with doxorubicin, vincristine, etoposide, prednisone, and cyclophosphamide (brentuximab vedotin group) or the standard pediatric regimen of doxorubicin, bleomycin, vincristine, etoposide, prednisone, and cyclophosphamide (standard-care group). Slow-responding lesions, defined by a score of 4 or 5 (on a 5-point scale, with scores of 1 to 3 indicating rapid-responding lesions), were identified on centrally reviewed positron-emission tomography-computed tomography after two cycles. Involved-site radiation therapy was administered after the fifth cycle of therapy to slow-responding lesions and to large mediastinal adenopathy that was present at diagnosis. The primary end point was event-free survival, defined as the time until disease progression occurred, relapse occurred, a second malignant neoplasm developed, or the patient died. Safety and overall survival were assessed. Of 600 patients who were enrolled across 153 institutions, 587 were eligible. At a median follow-up of 42.1 months (range, 0.1 to 80.9), the 3-year event-free survival was 92.1% (95% confidence interval [CI], 88.4 to 94.7) in the brentuximab vedotin group, as compared with 82.5% (95% CI, 77.4 to 86.5) in the standard-care group (hazard ratio for event or death, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.25 to 0.67; P<0.001).

The protein kinase B\/AKT acts as a central node in cellular metabolism and is constitutively active in MM cells. Despite the known role of AKT in modulating cellular metabolism, little is known about the downstream factors of AKT that control the metabolic adaptability of MM cells. Here, we demonstrate that negative regulation of the forkhead box O (FOXO) transcription factors (TF) by AKT is crucial to prevent metabolic shutdown in MM cells, thus contributing to their metabolic adaptability. Our results demonstrate that the expression of several key metabolic genes involved in glycolysis, the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and OXPHOS, are repressed by FOXO TFs. Moreover, the FOXO-dependent repression of glycolysis- and TCA-associated genes correlates with a favorable prognosis in a large MM patient cohort. Our data suggest that repression of FOXO by AKT is essential to sustain glycolysis and the TCA cycle activity in MM cells, and as such predicts patient survival.","query":"cancer"},"36322818":{"ArticleTitle":"Clinical outcomes associated with NPM1 mutations in patients with relapsed or refractory AML.","AbstractText":"Mutations in Nucleophosmin 1 (NPM1) are associated with a favorable prognosis in newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML), however, their prognostic impact in the relapsed\/refractory (R\/R) settings is unknown.

We sought to identify cooperating events through genomic analyses of a somatic Trp53R245W mouse model (equivalent to the TP53R248W hot spot mutation in human cancers) that recapitulates metastatic breast-cancer development. We identified cooperating lesions similar to those found in human breast cancers. Moreover, we identified activation of the Pi3k\/Akt\/mTOR pathway in most tumors via mutations in Pten, Erbb2, Kras, and\/or a recurrent Pip5k1c mutation that stabilizes the Pip5k1c protein and activates Pi3k\/Akt\/mTOR signaling. Another PIP5K1C family member, PIP5K1A, is coamplified with PI4KB in 18% of human breast cancer patients; both encode kinases that are responsible for production of the PI3K substrate, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate. Thus, the TP53R248W mutation and PI3K\/AKT\/mTOR signaling are major cooperative events driving breast-cancer development. Additionally, a combination of two US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs, tigecycline and metformin, which target oxidative phosphorylation downstream of PI3K signaling, inhibited tumor cell growth and may be repurposed for breast-cancer treatment. These findings advance our understanding of how mutant p53 drives breast-tumor development and pinpoint the importance of PI3K\/AKT\/mTOR signaling, expanding combination therapies for breast-cancer treatment.","query":"cancer"},"36322753":{"ArticleTitle":"IGF2BP2 promotes cancer progression by degrading the RNA transcript encoding a v-ATPase subunit.","AbstractText":"IGF2BP2 binds to a number of RNA transcripts and has been suggested to function as a tumor promoter, although little is known regarding the mechanisms that regulate its roles in RNA metabolism. Here we demonstrate that IGF2BP2 binds to the 3' untranslated region of the transcript encoding ATP6V1A, a catalytic subunit of the vacuolar ATPase (v-ATPase), and serves as a substrate for the NAD+-dependent deacetylase SIRT1, which regulates how IGF2BP2 affects the stability of the ATP6V1A transcript. When sufficient levels of SIRT1 are expressed, it catalyzes the deacetylation of IGF2BP2, which can bind to the ATP6V1A transcript but does not mediate its degradation. However, when SIRT1 expression is low, the acetylated form of IGF2BP2 accumulates, and upon binding to the ATP6V1A transcript recruits the XRN2 nuclease, which catalyzes transcript degradation. Thus, the stability of the ATP6V1A transcript is significantly compromised in breast cancer cells when SIRT1 expression is low or knocked-down. This leads to a reduction in the expression of functional v-ATPase complexes in cancer cells and to an impairment in their lysosomal activity, resulting in the production of a cellular secretome consisting of increased numbers of exosomes enriched in ubiquitinated protein cargo and soluble hydrolases, including cathepsins, that together combine to promote tumor cell survival and invasiveness. These findings describe a previously unrecognized role for IGF2BP2 in mediating the degradation of a messenger RNA transcript essential for lysosomal function and highlight how its sirtuin-regulated acetylation state can have significant biological and disease consequences.","query":"cancer"},"36322742":{"ArticleTitle":"Magnetosome-inspired synthesis of soft ferrimagnetic nanoparticles for magnetic tumor targeting.","AbstractText":"Magnetic targeting is one of the most promising approaches for improving the targeting efficiency by which magnetic drug carriers are directed using external magnetic fields to reach their targets. As a natural magnetic nanoparticle (MNP) of biological origin, the magnetosome is a special \"organelle\" formed by biomineralization in magnetotactic bacteria (MTB) and is essential for MTB magnetic navigation to respond to geomagnetic fields. The magnetic targeting of magnetosomes, however, can be hindered by the aggregation and precipitation of magnetosomes in water and biological fluid environments due to the strong magnetic attraction between particles. In this study, we constructed a magnetosome-like nanoreactor by introducing MTB Mms6 protein into a reverse micelle system. MNPs synthesized by thermal decomposition exhibit the same crystal morphology and magnetism (high saturation magnetization and low coercivity) as natural magnetosomes but have a smaller particle size. The DSPE-mPEG-coated magnetosome-like MNPs exhibit good monodispersion, penetrating the lesion area of a tumor mouse model to achieve magnetic enrichment by an order of magnitude more than in the control groups, demonstrating great prospects for biomedical magnetic targeting applications.","query":"cancer"},"36322706":{"ArticleTitle":"Ectopic circSTK39 expression ameliorates hydrogen peroxide-induced human lens epithelial cell apoptosis and oxidative stress through the miR-125a-5p\/ERCC6 pathway.","AbstractText":"More and more studies suggest that circular RNA (circRNA) is involved in the pathogenesis of age-related cataract (ARC).

ARC cell model was established by inducing lens epithelial cells (SRA01\/04) using hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). CircSTK39, microRNA-125a-5p (miR-125a-5p) and ERCC excision repair 6, chromatin remodeling factor (ERCC6) expression were detected by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Western blot was conducted to assess protein expression. Cell viability, proliferation and apoptosis were investigated by cell counting kit-8 assay, 5-Ethynyl-29-deoxyuridine assay and flow cytometry analysis, respectively. Oxidative stress was evaluated using commercial kits. Dual-luciferase reporter assay, RNA immunoprecipitation assay and RNA pull-down assay were used to identify the relationship between miR-125a-5p and circSTK39 or ERCC6. CircSTK39 and ERCC6 expression were significantly downregulated, but miR-125a-5p expression was upregulated in the lens tissues of ARC patients and H2O2-treated SRA01\/04 cells. H2O2 treatment led to decreased cell proliferation and increased cell apoptosis and oxidative stress, accompanied by the increases of C-caspase3 and Bax expression and the decrease of Bcl-2 expression; however, these effects were reversed after circSTK39 overexpression. MiR-125a-5p was found to participate in H2O2-triggered cell damage by interacting with circSTK39. Additionally, ERCC6 silencing inhibited circSTK39 overexpression-mediated action. Importantly, circSTK39 regulated ERCC6 expression by interaction with miR-125a-5p in H2O2-treated SRA01\/04 cells.

Fistula tracts were sampled during definitive surgery plus seton removal. Patient demographics, CD classification, medication strategy, and healing of pfCD were recorded. RNA sequencing was applied for transcriptomic profile analysis. NETs components, including myeloperoxidase (MPO), neutrophil elastase (NE), and citrullinated histone H3 (CitH3), were identified using immunofluorescence. Serum infliximab (IFX), anti-IFX antibodies, and tissue levels of IFX, adalimumab (ADA), MPO and CitH3 were determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Peptidyl arginine deiminase IV (PAD4), tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-&#945;, and NE were detected using immunohistochemistry. Gene expression levels of PAD family members were assessed with qPCR. Twenty-one patients were included, 15 of whom adopted IFX as maintenance treatment. RNA-seq revealed difference in neutrophil associated pathways between unhealed and healed fistulas. NETs components (MPO\/NE\/CitH3) were detectable in the fistulas and were parallel with the PAD4 levels. Eleven of 21 (52%) patients experienced complete healing of the pfCD 108 weeks post-operatively. Fistula NETs were significantly increased in patients with unhealed pfCD. Increased NETs were associated with abundant TNF-&#945; production and the absence of IFX in fistulas.

Key fragments containing crucial bases of parent aptamers were identified and evolved by iterative embedding to form chimeras. The termini of the optimized chimera were then fixed by hybridization to limit their flexibility. Robust aptamers with more stable structures and higher affinity were thus engineered. An anti-okadaic acid aptamer, anti-dinophysistoxin aptamer, and anti-phosphatidylserine (PS) aptamer were engineered in this way, with the affinity enhanced by 160.5-fold, 50.36-fold, and 39.28-fold over that of the parent aptamers, respectively. Furthermore, the practicability of the anti-PS aptamer was validated with a polyA-nanotetrahedron-assisted electrochemical aptasensor.

Up-regulation of sialic acid-containing glycans, termed hypersialylation, is a common feature of cancer-associated glycosylation, driving disease progression and immune escape through the engagement of Siglec receptors on tumor-infiltrating immune cells. Here, we show that tumor sialylation correlates with distinct immune states and reduced survival in human cancers. The targeted removal of Siglec ligands in the tumor microenvironment, using an antibody-sialidase conjugate, enhanced antitumor immunity and halted tumor progression in several murine models. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we revealed that desialylation repolarized tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). We also identified Siglec-E as the main receptor for hypersialylation on TAMs. Last, we found that genetic and therapeutic desialylation, as well as loss of Siglec-E, enhanced the efficacy of ICB.

Female mice were preferentially affected with myocarditis compared to male mice, consistent with a previously described genetic model of ICI myocarditis and emerging clinical data. Mechanistically, myocardial tissue from ICI-treated mice, the genetic mouse model, and human heart tissue from affected patients with ICI myocarditis all exhibited down-regulation of MANF (mesencephalic astrocyte-derived neurotrophic factor) and HSPA5 (heat shock 70-kDa protein 5) in the heart; this down-regulation was particularly notable in female mice.

Here, we showed that nuclear PKM2 (S37P-PKM2) in cardiomyocytes interacts with prosurvival and proapoptotic transcription factors, including GATA4, GATA6, and P53.

Trauma, infection, pulmonary pathologies (ie, lung cancer or tuberculosis), gastrointestinal pathologies (ie, esophageal\/gastric varices, Mallory-Weiss tears, esophagitis), coagulopathies, medications, and prolonged intubation have been shown to increase the risk of oropharyngeal hemorrhage. CASE REPORT A 54-year-old man with a medical history of alcohol use disorder, liver cirrhosis, portal hypertension, and gastric varices presented with altered mental status. He was subsequently intubated for airway protection. Bleeding from the oropharynx was later found. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and bronchoscopy were unrevealing. Computed tomography angiography (CTA) of the head and neck revealed active bleeding of the right posterior pharyngeal artery, which was emergently embolized. Over the next few days, he continued to bleed from the oropharynx and became hemodynamically unstable. CTA abdomen showed bleeding from gastric varices and large-volume hemoperitoneum with multiple sources of active bleeding from the liver, duodenum, and jejunum. CONCLUSIONS We present a rare case of spontaneous oropharyngeal hemorrhage and gastric variceal bleeding resulting in hemorrhagic shock in a cirrhotic patient with multiple predisposing factors. If a patient presents with spontaneous oropharyngeal hemorrhage, clinicians should consider bleeding from the oropharynx if EGD and bronchoscopy are unrevealing. Thus, an emergent CTA of the head and neck should be strongly considered to further evaluate a potential source of active bleeding, as delayed diagnosis can be life-threatening.","query":"cancer"},"36322480":{"ArticleTitle":"Ultrasound-Mediated Antitumor Therapy via Targeted Acoustic Release Carrier of Carbon Monoxide (TARC-CO).","AbstractText":"As one of the most valuable endogenous gas signaling molecules, carbon monoxide (CO) has been demonstrated in numerous studies to show excellent promise in the treatment of diseases, such as cancer. However, for many years, the inherent high affinity of CO for hemoglobin severely impeded the clinical transformation of CO-based treatments. Therefore, the controlled delivery of CO to target tissues has become a common challenge. Herein, an efficient ultrasonic-triggered and targeted CO release strategy was constructed based on a novel targeted acoustic release carrier of carbon monoxide (TARC-CO) that we synthesized in this study. The designed TARC-COs could afford a safe, stable, and ultrasound-guided delivery of CO in vivo by loading a specified dose of CO inside microbubbles, resulting in breast tumor suppression. Taking advantage of the high loading capacity of microbubbles, the unit volume of TARC-CO suspension could encapsulate up to 337.1 &#177; 8.0 (&#215;103 ppm) of CO. In addition, the satisfactory ultrasound contrast-enhanced ability of TARC-COs achieved real-time interactive guidance and visual policing of CO delivery. For the in vitro antitumor study, TARC-COs with ultrasonic irradiation were demonstrated to effectively induce mitochondrial dysfunction by reducing mitochondrial membrane potential, leading to the apoptosis of 4T1 cells. In addition, we realized that TARC-CO-based treatment could significantly slow the growth rate of tumors by inducing apoptosis, inhibiting the proliferation of cancer cells, and limiting tumor angiogenesis. In summary, this proof-of-concept study demonstrates the feasibility and tremendous potential of TARC-COs for controlled release of CO, which can be expected to provide new inspirations and a promising perspective for therapy based on active gases.","query":"cancer"},"36322473":{"ArticleTitle":"A cytotoxic survey on 2-amino-1H-imidazol based synthetic marine sponge alkaloid analogues.","AbstractText":"Here, we describe the synthesis and biologic activity evaluation of 20 novel synthetic marine sponge alkaloid analogues with 2-amino-1H-imidazol (2-AI) core. Cytotoxicity was tested on murine 4T1 breast cancer, A549 human lung cancer, and HL-60 human myeloid leukemia cells by the resazurin assay. A total of 18 of 20 compounds showed cytotoxic effect on the cancer cell lines with different potential. Viability of healthy human fibroblasts and peripheral blood mononuclear cells upon treatment was less hampered compared to cancer cell lines supporting tumor cell specific cytotoxicity of our compounds. The most cytotoxic compounds resulted the following IC50 values 28: 2.91&#8201;&#181;M on HL-60 cells, and 29: 3.1&#8201;&#181;M on 4T1 cells. The A549 cells were less sensitive to the treatments with IC50 15&#8201;&#181;M for both 28 and 29. Flow cytometry demonstrated the apoptotic effect of the most active seven compounds inducing phosphatidylserine exposure and sub-G1 fragmentation of nuclear DNA. Cell cycle arrest was also observed. Four compounds caused depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane potential as an early event of apoptosis. Two lead compounds inhibited tumor growth in vivo in the 4T1 triple negative breast cancer and A549 human lung adenocarcinoma xenograft models. Novel marine sponge alkaloid analogues are demonstrated as potential anticancer agents for further development.","query":"cancer"},"36322465":{"ArticleTitle":"Benchmarking of robotic and laparoscopic spleen-preserving distal pancreatectomy by using two different methods.","AbstractText":"Benchmarking is an important tool for quality comparison and improvement.

Benchmarks for 10 outcomes were calculated using the Achievable Benchmark of Care (ABC) and best-patient-in-best-centre methods. Overall, 951 laparoscopically assisted (77.3 per cent) and 279 robotically assisted (22.7 per cent) procedures were included. Using the ABC method, the benchmarks for laparoscopically assisted and robotically assisted spleen-preserving distal pancreatectomy respectively were: 150 and 207&#8197;min for duration of operation, 55 and 100&#8197;ml for blood loss, 3.5 and 1.7 per cent for conversion, 0 and 1.7 per cent for failure to preserve the spleen, 27.3 and 34.0 per cent for overall morbidity, 5.1 and 3.3 per cent for major morbidity, 3.6 and 7.1 per cent for pancreatic fistula grade B\/C, 5 and 6 days for duration of hospital stay, 2.9 and 5.4 per cent for readmissions, and 0 and 0 per cent for 90-day mortality.

In 1981, Best and Hoekstra reported four patients with BWSp in a single family which suggested autosomal dominant inheritance, but standard clinical testing for BWSp was not available during this time. Meticulous phenotyping of this family has occurred over the past 40&#8201;years of follow-up with additional family members being identified and samples collected for genetic testing. Genetic testing revealed a pathogenic mutation in CDKN1C, consistent with the most common cause of familial BWSp. CDKN1C mutations account for just 5% of sporadic cases of BWSp. Here, we report the variable presentation of BWSp across the individuals affected by the CDKN1C mutation and other extended family members spanning multiple generations, all examined by the same physician. Additional phenotypes thought to be atypical in patients with BWSp were reported which included cardiac abnormalities. The incidence of tumors was documented in extended family members and included rhabdomyosarcoma, astrocytoma, and thyroid carcinoma, which have previously been reported in patients with BWSp. These observations suggest that in addition to the inheritance of the CDKN1C variant, there are modifying factors in this family driving the phenotypic spectrum observed. Alternative theories are suggested to explain the etiology of clinical variability including diffused mosaicism, anticipation, and the presence of additional variants tracking in the family. This study highlights the necessity of long-term follow-up in patients with BWSp and consideration of individual familial characteristics in the context of phenotype and\/or (epi)genotype associations.","query":"cancer"},"36322456":{"ArticleTitle":"Mechanisms governing target search and binding dynamics of hypoxia-inducible factors.","AbstractText":"Transcription factors (TFs) are classically attributed a modular construction, containing well-structured sequence specific DNA-binding domains (DBDs) paired with disordered activation domains (ADs) responsible for protein-protein interactions targeting cofactors or the core transcription initiation machinery. However, this simple division of labor model struggles to explain why TFs with identical DNA binding sequence specificity determined in vitro exhibit distinct binding profiles in vivo. The family of Hypoxia-Inducible Factors (HIFs) offer a stark example: aberrantly expressed in several cancer types, HIF-1&#945; and HIF-2&#945; subunit isoforms recognize the same DNA motif in vitro - the hypoxia response element (HRE) - but only share a subset of their target genes in vivo, while eliciting contrasting effects on cancer development and progression under certain circumstances. To probe the mechanisms mediating isoform-specific gene regulation, we used live cell single particle tracking (SPT) to investigate HIF nuclear dynamics and how they change upon genetic perturbation or drug treatment. We found that HIF-&#945; subunits and their dimerization partner HIF-1&#946; exhibit distinct diffusion and binding characteristics that are exquisitely sensitive to concentration and subunit stoichiometry. Using domain-swap variants, mutations, and a HIF-2&#945; specific inhibitor, we found that although the DBD and dimerization domains are important, another main determinant of chromatin binding and diffusion behavior is the AD-containing intrinsically disordered region (IDR). Using Cut&Run and RNA-seq as orthogonal genomic approaches we also confirmed IDR-dependent binding and activation of a specific subset of HIF-target genes. These findings reveal a previously unappreciated role of IDRs in regulating the TF search and binding process that contribute to functional target site selectivity on chromatin.","query":"cancer"},"36322450":{"ArticleTitle":"Liquid Biopsy and Immuno-Oncology for Advanced Nonsmall Cell Lung Cancer.","AbstractText":"In the last decade, immune checkpoint inhibitors have revolutionized the treatment of metastatic nonsmall cell lung cancer without oncogenic addiction.

However, the performance of different long-read sequencing platforms for the analysis of long cfDNA remains unknown. Size biases of SMRT sequencing by Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) and nanopore sequencing by Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) were evaluated using artificial mixtures of sonicated human and mouse DNA of different sizes. cfDNA from plasma samples of pregnant women at different trimesters, hepatitis B carriers, and patients with hepatocellular carcinoma were sequenced with the 2 platforms. Both platforms showed biases to sequence longer (1500&#8197;bp vs 200&#8197;bp) DNA fragments, with PacBio showing a stronger bias (5-fold overrepresentation of long fragments vs 2-fold in ONT). Percentages of cfDNA fragments > 500&#8197;bp were around 6-fold higher in PacBio compared with ONT. End motif profiles of cfDNA from PacBio and ONT were similar, yet exhibited platform-dependent patterns.

In this article, approaches that address these challenges are assessed. Using retrospective analysis of a recent ATAD2 hit-identification campaign, alongside other examples of successful fragment-screening campaigns, it is suggested that hit validation and prioritization are best achieved by a `triangulation' approach in which the results of multiple available biochemical and biophysical techniques are correlated to develop qualitative structure-activity relationships (SARs).

An initial response to an epithelial wound is an increase in cytosolic calcium followed by complex calcium signaling events. While these calcium signals are driven by both physical and chemical wound responses, cells around the wound will all be equipped with the same cellular components to produce and interact with the calcium signals. Here, we have developed a mathematical model in the context of laser-ablation of the Drosophila pupal notum that integrates tissue-level damage models with a cellular calcium signaling toolkit. The model replicates experiments in the contexts of control wounds as well as knockdowns of specific cellular components, but it also provides new insights that are not easily accessible experimentally. The model suggests that cell-cell variability is necessary to produce calcium signaling events observed in experiments, it quantifies calcium concentrations during wound-induced signaling events, and it shows that intercellular transfer of the molecule IP3 is required to coordinate calcium signals across distal cells around the wound. The mathematical model developed here serves as a framework for quantitative studies in both wound signaling and calcium signaling in the Drosophila system.

Develop a molecular signature that can identify MIBC NAC responders (R) and non-responders (NR) using a cohort of known NAC response phenotypes, and better understand differences in molecular pathways and subtype classifications between NAC R and NR. Presented are the messenger RNA (mRNA) and microRNA (miRNA) differential expression profiles from initial transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) specimens of a discovery cohort of MIBC patients consisting of 7 known NAC R and 11 NR, and a validation cohort consisting of 3 R and 5 NR. Pathological response at time of cystectomy after NAC was used to classify initial TURBT specimens as R (pT0) versus NR (&#8805;pT2). RNA and miRNA from FFPE blocks were sequenced using RNAseq and qPCR, respectively. The discovery cohort had 2309 genes, while the validation cohort had 602 genes and 13 miRNA differentially expressed between R and NR. Gene set enrichment analysis identified mitochondrial gene expression, DNA replication initiation, DNA unwinding in the R discovery cohort and positive regulation of vascular associated smooth muscle cell proliferation in the NR discovery cohort. Canonical correlation (CC) analysis was applied to differentiate R versus NR. 3 CCs (CC13, CC16, and CC17) had an AUC >0.65 in the discovery and validation dataset. Gene ontology enrichment showed CC13 as nucleoside triphosphate metabolic process, CC16 as cell cycle and cellular response to DNA damage, CC17 as DNA packaging complex. All patients were classified using established molecular subtypes: Baylor, UNC, CIT, Lund, MD Anderson, TCGA, and Consensus Class. The MD Anderson p53-like subtype, CIT MC4 subtype and Consensus Class stroma rich subtype had the strongest correlation with a NR phenotype, while no subtype had a strong correlation with the R phenotype.

TTBK2 is also implicated in the stability of the assembled cilium, through mechanisms that remain to be defined. Here, we use mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) derived from Ttbk2fl\/fl; UBC-CreERT+ embryos (hereafter Ttbk2cmut) to dissect the role of TTBK2 in cilium stability. This system depletes TTBK2 levels after cilia formation, allowing us to assess the molecular changes to the assembled cilium over time. As a consequence of Ttbk2 deletion, the ciliary axoneme is destabilized and primary cilia are lost within 48-72 hours following recombination. Axoneme destabilization involves an increased frequency of cilia breaks and a reduction in axonemal microtubule modifications. Cilia loss was delayed by using inhibitors that affect actin-based trafficking. At the same time, we find that TTBK2 is required to regulate the composition of the centriolar satellites and to maintain the basal body pools of intraflagellar transport (IFT) proteins.

Dietary trans fatty acids increased the risk of CRC, whereas tissue trans fatty acids had a protective effect on CRC. Nonetheless, neither type of trans fatty acid increased the risk of colon or rectal cancer; thus, more prospective studies are needed to determine the validity of these associations.","query":"cancer"},"36322275":{"ArticleTitle":"Longer Time Interval from Neoadjuvant Chemoradiation to Surgery is Associated with Poor Survival for Patients Without Clinical Complete Response in Oesophageal Cancer.","AbstractText":"The optimal interval between neoadjuvant therapy and oesophagectomy for oesophageal cancer remains controversial. Patients with locally advanced oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) who received neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy followed by oesophagectomy between June 2017 and December 2020 were prospectively enrolled and retrospectively analysed. Patients were divided into two groups: timely (group A; < 10 weeks) and delayed (group B; &#8805; 10 weeks) surgery groups. Survival was the primary outcome, and tumour response and post-operative complications were the secondary outcomes. Overall, 224 patients were recruited; 116 patients (51.8%) underwent timely surgery within 10 weeks (group A), and 108 patients (49.2%) underwent delayed surgery over 10 weeks (group B) after chemoradiotherapy. In patients with clinical complete response (cCR), two groups had no significant difference of survival benefit (P = 0.618). However, in patients without cCR, delayed surgery was associated with poor survival (P = 0.035) and cancer progression (P = 0.036). A total of 40 patients (34.5%) in group A and 54 patients (50.0%) in group B achieved pCR (P = 0.019). pCR rates were significantly different across the four groups and increased over time (P = 0.006). Patients with a prolonged time interval from neoadjuvant chemoradiation to surgery had higher pCR rates. For patients with cCR to neoadjuvant chemoradiation, the time interval to surgery can be safely prolonged for at least 10 weeks. However, for patients with non-cCR to neoadjuvant chemoradiation, delayed surgery is associated with poor survival, and surgery should be performed within 10 weeks of neoadjuvant chemoradiation.","query":"cancer"},"36322273":{"ArticleTitle":"ASO Author Reflections: Timing of Oesophagectomy After Neoadjuvant Chemoradiotherapy for Locally Advanced Oesophageal Cancer.","AbstractText":"","query":"cancer"},"36322272":{"ArticleTitle":"ASO Author Reflections: Low Genetic Testing Utilization Among Patients with Breast, Ovarian, Pancreatic, and Prostate Cancers.","AbstractText":"","query":"cancer"},"36322248":{"ArticleTitle":"Mind-body practices for cancer-related symptoms management: an overview of systematic reviews including one hundred twenty-nine meta-analyses.","AbstractText":"Mind-body practices such as qigong, tai chi, or yoga combine physical movements, deep breathing, and meditation techniques aiming to improve how people self-care.

CINAHL, Embase, PsycINFO, PubMed, and the Cochrane Library were used to search systematic reviews with meta-analysis from inception until March 2022. Cancer-related symptoms such as fatigue, pain, psychological measures, and overall quality of life were chosen as outcomes of interest. The methodological quality of each systematic review was assessed using AMSTAR 2. Citation matrices were developed, and the corrected covered area was calculated to explore the potential primary study overlap. A total of 38 systematic reviews comprising 134 distinct primary studies and 129 separate meta-analyses were included. The items of AMSTAR 2 regarding the review protocol, the reasons to choose a specific research design, and the provision of a list of studies that justify their exclusion were scarcely performed. The primary study overlap was moderate for qigong trials and high for both tai chi and yoga trials. Mainly, we found that qigong showed promising effects to reduce fatigue. Tai chi produced positive effects in reducing anxiety. Yoga improved anxiety, depression, distress, stress, and overall quality of life. Finally, the effects of mind-body practices on pain were inconsistent. Qigong, tai chi, and yoga could be effective approaches to relief cancer-related symptoms in adults with different cancer diagnoses.","query":"cancer"},"36322247":{"ArticleTitle":"Experiences of patients and providers while using telemedicine in cancer care during COVID-19 pandemic: a systematic review and meta-synthesis of qualitative literature.","AbstractText":"The objective of this meta-synthesis was to identify, appraise, and synthesize patients and provider's experiences while using telemedicine in cancer care during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Notable outcomes included imaging outcomes of cardiotoxicity, cardiorespiratory fitness, and cardiac biomarkers. A meta-analysis of the pooled evidence obtained from seven studies revealed that AE significantly increased peak oxygen consumption (VO2 peak) and E\/A values, compared to the values observed during usual care. Moreover, AE was safe and feasible, and was associated with a lower risk of adverse effects, a higher participation rate, and better results, when combined with resistance exercise. In BC patients receiving anthracyclines or trastuzumab, the effects of AE on the levels of cardiotoxicity were mixed; the diastolic functions and VO2 peak values were improved, biomarkers were not affected, and the overall improvements in the levels of cardiotoxicity were promising, despite the use of different exercise parameters.","query":"cancer"},"36322231":{"ArticleTitle":"Self-reported history of comorbidities and markers of ovarian reserve among subfertile women.","AbstractText":"To investigate whether history of comorbidities is associated with markers of ovarian reserve among subfertile women.

Women completed a comprehensive questionnaire including medical diagnosis of comorbidities. Ovarian reserve markers including antral follicle count (AFC), assessed by transvaginal ultrasound, and circulating serum levels of day 3 FSH and AMH, are assessed by immunoassays. We fit linear regression models to evaluate the association between history of comorbidities and markers of ovarian reserve while adjusting for confounders. Self-reported history of hypertension, cancer, and neurological disorders was negatively associated with AFC in unadjusted models and in adjusted models for age, smoking, physical activity, comorbidity count, and BMI. Adjusted mean AFC (95% CI) was lower among women with history of hypertension, compared to women with no self-reported history of hypertension (11.5 vs 15.6, p value 0.0001).

In this context, we set out to determine the concentrations of heavy metals in the muscle of two fish species of commercial interest, Chelon auratus and Chelon saliens on the south coast of the Caspian Sea. We aimed to assess the degree of environment contamination in this area and to estimate the potential risk to human health derived from the consumption of fish. The mean concentrations of the different metals analysed were very varied in both species. In fact, some concentrations exceeded the permissible limits for the protection of human health for Cd and Pb, and some values of As were above those referenced by other authors in same species in the Caspian Sea. None of the estimated daily intake values exceeded the tolerable intake based on the consumption under consideration. Nonetheless, the accumulative hazard values evidenced a potential risk to human health, Pb and Hg being those giving a higher target hazard quotient. The cancer risk from exposure to As from fish consumption in children was above the \"acceptable\" risk to life. Thus, in view of the accumulative nature of heavy metals, a moderate and non-abusive fish consumption in this area, particularly in children, would be recommendable.","query":"cancer"},"36322193":{"ArticleTitle":"Detection efficacy of analog [18F]FDG PET\/CT, digital [18F]FDG, and [13N]NH3 PET\/CT: a prospective, comparative study of patients with lung adenocarcinoma featuring ground glass nodules.","AbstractText":"This prospective study compared the detection efficacy of analog 18F-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose (18F-FDG) positron emission tomography (PET)\/computed tomography (CT) (aF PET\/CT), digital [18F]FDG PET\/CT (dF PET\/CT), and digital 13N-ammonia (13N-NH3) PET\/CT (dN PET\/CT) for patients with lung adenocarcinoma featuring ground glass nodules (GGNs).

Similar to their micron-scale counterparts, microbubbles (1-10 &#956;m), they can act as ultrasound contrast agents as well as locally enhance therapeutic uptake. Recently, it has been shown that the reduced size of NBs (<1 &#956;m) promotes increased uptake and accumulation in tumor interstitial space, which can enhance their diagnostic and therapeutic performance. However, accurate characterization of NB size and concentration is challenging and may limit their translation into clinical use. Their submicron nature limits accuracy of conventional microscopy techniques, while common light scattering techniques fail to distinguish between subpopulations present in NB samples (i.e., bubbles and liposomes). Due to the difficulty in the characterization of NBs, relatively little is known about the influence of size on their therapeutic performance. In this study, we describe a novel method of using a commercially available nanoparticle tracking analysis system, to distinguish between NBs and liposomes based on their differing optical properties. We used this technique to characterize three NB populations of varying size, isolated via centrifugation, and subsequently used this to assess their potential for enhancing localized delivery. Confocal fluorescence microscopy and image analysis were used to quantify the ultrasound enhanced uptake of fluorescent dextran into live colorectal cancer cells. Our results showed that the amount of localized uptake did not follow the expected trends, in which larger NB populations out-perform smaller NBs, at matched concentration. To understand this observed behavior, the stability of each NB population was assessed. It was found that dilution of the NB samples from their stock concentration influences their stability, and it is hypothesized that both the total free lipid and interbubble distance play a role in NB lifetime, in agreement with previously proposed theories and models.","query":"cancer"},"36322168":{"ArticleTitle":"Rare Association Between Osteogenesis Imperfecta and Chondrosarcoma: Could a Pathogenic Variant in the Gene SERPINF1 Explain It?","AbstractText":"Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) type VI is a rare inherited disorder of the connective tissue caused by pathogenic variants in&#160;SERPINF1 gene, which encodes the pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF).

He presented with hypotonia and bilateral femur fractures at birth, later developing bilateral Achilles' contractures, scoliosis, and elbow and knee contractures. He had walking difficulties throughout childhood and became wheelchair bound from age 13 after prolonged immobilisation.

Some indirect data suggest that the pandemic has worsened the stage at which some non-hematological neoplasms are diagnosed. Despite the lack of robust evidence, oncology patients seem more likely to have a poor outcome when they contract COVID-19. The antibody response to infection in cancer patients will be fundamentally conditioned by the type of neoplasia present, the treatment received and the time of its administration.

The severity and mortality of COVID-19 in patients with hematologic malignancies is clearly higher than the general population. Since the immune response to vaccination in hematologic patients is generally worse than in comparable populations, alternative methods of prevention must be established in these patients, as well as actions for earlier diagnosis and treatment.

In recent years, telerehabilitation has opened a new pathway for nurses to manage chronic diseases at a distance; however, it remains unclear which chronic disease patients benefit the most from this innovative delivery mode. This study aims to summarize current components of community-based, nurse-led telerehabilitation programs using the chronic care model; evaluate the effectiveness of nurse-led telerehabilitation programs compared with traditional face-to-face rehabilitation programs; and compare the effects of telerehabilitation on patients with different chronic diseases. A systematic review and meta-analysis were performed using 6 databases for articles published from 2015 to 2021. Studies comparing the effectiveness of telehealth rehabilitation with face-to-face rehabilitation for people with hypertension, cardiac diseases, chronic respiratory diseases, diabetes, cancer, or stroke were included. Quality of life was the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes included physical indicators, self-care, psychological impacts, and health-resource use. The revised Cochrane risk of bias tool for randomized trials was employed to assess the methodological quality of the included studies. A meta-analysis was conducted using a random-effects model and illustrated with forest plots. A total of 26 studies were included in the meta-analysis. Telephone follow-ups were the most commonly used telerehabilitation delivery approach. Chronic care model components, such as nurses-patient communication, self-management support, and regular follow-up, were involved in all telerehabilitation programs. Compared with traditional face-to-face rehabilitation groups, statistically significant improvements in quality of life (cardiac diseases: standard mean difference [SMD] 0.45; 95% CI 0.09 to 0.81; P=.01; heterogeneity: X21=1.9; I2=48%; P=.16; chronic respiratory diseases: SMD 0.18; 95% CI 0.05 to 0.31; P=.007; heterogeneity: X22=1.7; I2=0%; P=.43) and self-care (cardiac diseases: MD 5.49; 95% CI 2.95 to 8.03; P<.001; heterogeneity: X25=6.5; I2=23%; P=.26; diabetes: SMD 1.20; 95% CI 0.55 to 1.84; P<.001; heterogeneity: X24=46.3; I2=91%; P<.001) were observed in the groups that used telerehabilitation.

Despite these positive findings, telerehabilitation was found to have no statistically significant effect on improving patients' anxiety level, depression level, or hospital admission rate. This review showed that telerehabilitation programs could be beneficial to patients with chronic disease in the community. However, better designed nurse-led telerehabilitation programs are needed, such as those involving the transfer of nurse-patient clinical data. The heterogeneity between studies was moderate to high.

To compare the symptom spectrum of patient-reported CIPN associated with nab-paclitaxel, paclitaxel, and docetaxel treatments among patients with breast cancer. This prospective cohort study was conducted at 9 medical centers across China from 2019 to 2021. Participants included hospitalized women diagnosed with invasive breast cancer, assessed with overlap propensity score weighting. Data were analyzed from from December 2021 to May 2022. Treatment with nab-paclitaxel-, paclitaxel-, or docetaxel-based regimens. Patient-reported CIPN on the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire: CIPN 20-item instruments, consisting of sensory, motor, and autonomic scales. Multiple regression models were adjusted for baseline patient, tumor, and treatment characteristics. Of 1234 participants, the mean (SD) age was 50.9 (10.4) years, and 295 patients (23.9%) received nab-paclitaxel, 514 patients (41.7%) received paclitaxel, and 425 patients (34.4%) received docetaxel. The nab-paclitaxel group mostly reported numbness in hands or feet related to sensory symptoms (83 patients [81.4%]), while the paclitaxel and docetaxel groups reported mainly motor (eg, weakness in legs: 60 patients [47.2%] in the paclitaxel group; 52 patients [44.4%] in the docetaxel group) and autonomic (eg, blurred vision: 58 patients [45.7%] in the paclitaxel group; 51 patients [43.6%] in the docetaxel group) symptoms. Patients reported motor symptoms earlier than sensory abnormalities, with a median of 0.4 (95% CI, 0.4-2.3) weeks in the nab-paclitaxel group, 2.7 (95% CI, 1.7-3.4) weeks in the paclitaxel group, and 5.6 (95% CI, 3.1-6.1) weeks in the docetaxel group. After overlap propensity score weighting and compared with the nab-paclitaxel group, the risks of patient-reported CIPN were lower in the paclitaxel (hazard ratio [HR], 0.59 [95% CI, 0.41-0.87]; P&#8201;=&#8201;.008) and the docetaxel (HR, 0.65 [95% CI, 0.45-0.94]; P&#8201;=&#8201;.02) groups.

However, the risk of patients in the paclitaxel or docetaxel groups reporting motor (paclitaxel: HR, 0.76 [95% CI, 0.52-1.11]; P&#8201;=&#8201;.15; docetaxel: HR, 0.69 [95% CI, 0.47-1.01]; P&#8201;=&#8201;.05) and\/or autonomic (paclitaxel: HR, 1.00 [95% CI, 0.68-1.49]; P&#8201;=&#8201;.98; docetaxel: HR, 0.88 [95% CI, 0.59-1.30]; P&#8201;=&#8201;.52) symptoms was not lower than that in the nab-paclitaxel group. In this cohort study of women with invasive breast cancer, nab-paclitaxel was associated with more severe CIPN than either paclitaxel or docetaxel. In addition to sensory symptoms, the risk of motor and autonomic abnormalities was not low among these 3 taxanes, and patients-reported motor symptoms even earlier than sensory symptoms. These findings may facilitate early detection and intervention for CIPN in taxane treatments for breast cancer.","query":"cancer"},"36322071":{"ArticleTitle":"Non-internalising antibody-drug conjugates.","AbstractText":"Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) typically require internalisation into cancer cells to release their cytotoxic payload. However, this places stringent constraints on therapeutic development, requiring cancer targets that have high expression of internalising antigens and efficient intracellular processing. An alternative approach is emerging whereby the payloads can be released extracellularly from cleavable linkers upon binding to poorly-internalising antigens or other tumoral components. This removes the reliance on high antigen expression, avoids potentially inefficient internalisation, and can greatly expand the range of cancer targets to components of the extracellular tumour matrix. This review gives an overview of recent developments towards non-internalising ADCs, including emerging cancer-associated cell surface and extracellular proteins, cancer stromal targeting and the linking chemistry that enables extracellular payload release.","query":"cancer"},"36322063":{"ArticleTitle":"Follow-up of Patients With Keratinocyte Carcinoma: A Systematic Review of Clinical Practice Guidelines.","AbstractText":"Patients treated for cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and basal cell carcinoma (BCC), collectively called keratinocyte carcinoma (KC), are at risk for recurrence, metastasis, and additional primary cutaneous malignant neoplasms. It is unclear how often patients should be seen for follow-up skin examination after initial treatment of KC. To summarize the recommendations and evaluate the methodological quality of clinical practice guidelines for dermatologic follow-up of patients with BCC and invasive SCC. PubMed, MEDLINE, and Embase were searched for relevant articles published from January 2010 to March 2022. Search terms included guideline, squamous cell carcinoma, and basal cell carcinoma. National or international guidelines containing recommendations for follow-up frequency after a diagnosis of localized cutaneous KC were included. Quality was assessed using the 6 domains of the Appraisal of Guidelines Research and Evaluation II (AGREE II) tool: (1) scope and purpose; (2) stakeholder development; (3) rigor of development; (4) clarity of presentation; (5) applicability; and (6) editorial independence. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis Protocols (PRISMA-P) was used to guide study reporting. Among the 14 guidelines meeting eligibility criteria, there was little consensus on the appropriate follow-up frequency after initial KC treatment. Overall duration of follow-up ranged from a single posttreatment visit to lifelong surveillance. Most guidelines stratified their recommendations by recurrence risk. For low-risk BCC and guidelines that did not stratify by risk, follow-up recommendations ranged from every 6 to 12 months. For high-risk BCC, 1 guideline suggested follow-up every 3 months, while 4 recommended every 6 months. For low-risk SCC, 5 guidelines recommended annual follow-up; 3 guidelines, every 6 months; and 1 guideline, every 3 months. For high-risk SCC, recommendations included a range of follow-up frequencies, spanning every 3 months (n&#8201;=&#8201;5 guidelines), 4 months (n&#8201;=&#8201;1), 6 months (n&#8201;=&#8201;6), or annually (n&#8201;=&#8201;4). One guideline did not use risk stratification and recommended annual screening. The highest scoring AGREE II domain was \"scope and purpose,\" which assessed the guideline's overall objectives, and the lowest scoring was \"applicability,\" which assessed barriers and facilitators to implementation. The findings of this systemic review highlight variations in follow-up recommendations for patients after initial treatment for KC.

To assess the efficacy of electroacupuncture (EA) in reducing the duration of POI with the ERAS protocol. This multicenter, randomized, sham-controlled trial was conducted in China from October 12, 2020, through October 17, 2021. There was a 1:1 allocation using the dynamic block random method, and analyses were by intention to treat. Patients 18 years or older undergoing laparoscopic resection of colorectal cancer for the first time were randomly assigned to treatment group by a central system. Patients were randomly assigned to 4 sessions of EA or sham electroacupuncture (SA) after surgery. All patients were treated within the ERAS protocol. The primary outcome was the time to first defecation. Secondary outcomes included other patient-reported outcome measures, length of postoperative hospital stay, readmission rate within 30 days, and incidence of postoperative complications and adverse events. A total of 249 patients were randomly assigned to treatment groups. After the exclusion of 1 patient because of a diagnosis of intestinal tuberculosis, 248 patients (mean [SD] age, 60.2 [11.4] years; 153 men [61.7%]) were included in the analyses. The median (IQR) time to first defecation was 76.4 (67.6-96.8) hours in the EA group and 90.0 (73.6-100.3) hours in the SA group (mean difference, -8.76; 95% CI, -15.80 to -1.73; P&#8201;=&#8201;.003). In the EA group compared with the SA group, the time to first flatus (median [IQR], 44.3 [37.0-58.2] hours vs 58.9 [48.2-67.4] hours; P < .001) and the tolerability of semiliquid diet (median [IQR], 105.8 [87.0-120.3] hours vs 116.5 [92.0-137.0] hours; P = .01) and solid food (median [IQR], 181.8 [149.5-211.4] hours vs 190.3 [165.0-228.5] hours; P = .01) were significantly decreased.

The strategy to suppress the detraining-induced reduction of mitochondrial content has not been fully elucidated. As previous studies reported that branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) ingestion increased mitochondrial content in skeletal muscle, we evaluated whether BCAA supplementation could suppress the detraining-induced reduction of mitochondrial content. Six-week-old male Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) mice were randomly divided into four groups as follows: control (Con), endurance training (Tr), detraining (DeTr), and detraining with BCAA supplementation (DeTr&#8201;+&#8201;BCAA). Mice in Tr, DeTr, and DeTr&#8201;+&#8201;BCAA performed treadmill running exercises [20-30&#8201;m\/min, 60&#8201;min, 5 times\/week, 4&#8201;weeks]. Then, mice in DeTr and DeTr&#8201;+&#8201;BCAA were administered with water or BCAA [0.6&#160;mg\/g of body weight, twice daily] for 2&#8201;weeks of detraining. In whole skeletal muscle, mitochondrial enzyme activities and protein content were decreased after 2&#8201;weeks of detraining, but the reduction was suppressed by BCAA supplementation. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor &#947; coactivator-1&#945; (PGC-1&#945;) protein content, a master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis, was decreased by detraining irrespective of BCAA ingestion. Regarding mitochondrial degradation, BCL2\/adenovirus E1B 19&#8201;kDa protein-interacting protein 3 (BNIP3), a mitophagy-related protein, was significantly higher in the Tr group than in the DeTr&#8201;+&#8201;BCAA group, but not different from in the DeTr group. With respect to mitochondrial quality, BCAA ingestion did not affect oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in isolated mitochondria. Our findings suggest that BCAA ingestion suppresses the detraining-induced reduction of mitochondrial content partly through inhibiting mitophagy.","query":"cancer"},"36322019":{"ArticleTitle":"Safety and health immigrant paediatric oncology patients: a qualitative study.","AbstractText":"A \"risky situation\" is a situation that potentially can lead to adverse event.

Nurses were interviewed until data saturation was achieved. Analysis was conducted using the thematic synthesis approach. The results include the three main themes: \"language barriers\" , \"therapeutic education\" (sub-themes: hygiene, food beverages, behavioural rules), \"resources\". These mentioned factors seem influence, in turn, the safety of the paediatric patient . The results suggest linguistic barriers put at risk the whole relationship of care patient-family-nurse and is likely to jeopardize the patient's safety.

Pulmonary toxicity of immunotherapy covers a broad range of pulmonary manifestations and is often referred to as pneumonitis. It is a severe and potentially life-threatening immune-related adverse events (irAEs) that requires early identification and management. The diagnosis of CIP should be carefully distinguished from other forms of pulmonary diseases. Recognizing risk factors and typical symptoms helps to raise suspicion of CIP. Further characterization of the unique radiographic and pathological features is warranted to expedite diagnosis. The identification of potential biomarkers for CIP is emerging and has great relevance in the clinic. Multidisciplinary collaborations involving oncologists, radiologists and pulmonologists may facilitate uniform management strategies. Treatment discontinuation is the mainstay for treating CIP of all grades. Systemic steroids are considered for pneumonitis at least grade 2 and immunosuppressive drugs are recommended for CIP patients refractory to steroids. In the future, more diagnosis and management strategies are needed to provide new insights and treatment options. There are achievements and shortcomings in the current status of the diagnosis and treatment for CIP.

This was a retrospective study that evaluated the relationship between conditioning regimens exposure in 1,188 allo-HCT recipients and the gut microbiome. Stool samples collected from 20 days before transplantation up to 30 days after were profiled using 16S rRNA sequencing. Microbiota injury was quantified by changes in &#945;-diversity. We identified distinct patterns of microbiota injury that varied by conditioning regimen. Diversity loss was graded into three levels of conditioning-associated microbiota injury (CMBI) in a multivariable model that included antibiotic exposures. High-intensity regimens, such as total body irradiation (TBI)-thiotepa-cyclophosphamide, were associated with the greatest injury loss (CMBI III). In contrast, the non-myeloablative regimen fludarabine-cyclophosphamide with low-dose TBI (Flu\/Cy\/TBI200) had a low-grade injury (CMBI I). The risk of acute graft-versus-host disease correlated with CMBI degree. Pre-transplant microbial compositions were best preserved with Flu\/Cy\/TBI200, whereas other regimens were associated with loss of commensal bacteria and expansion of Enterococcus. Our findings support an interaction between conditioning at the regimen level and the extent of microbiota injury.","query":"cancer"},"36322002":{"ArticleTitle":"The combination of trametinib and ganitumab is effective in RAS-mutated PAX-fusion negative rhabdomyosarcoma models.","AbstractText":"PAX-fusion negative rhabdomyosarcoma (FN RMS) is driven by alterations in the RAS\/MAP kinase pathway and is partially responsive to MEK inhibition. Overexpression of IGF1R and its ligands is also observed in FN RMS. Preclinical and clinical studies have suggested that IGF1R is itself an important target in FN RMS. Here, we sought to identify a combination of an MEK1\/2 inhibitor and IGF1R inhibitor that would be tolerated in murine models and effective in both cell line and patient derived xenograft models of RAS-mutant FN RMS. Using proliferation and apoptosis assays, we studied the factorial effects of trametinib and ganitumab (AMG 479), a monoclonal antibody with specificity for human and murine IGF1R, in a panel of RAS-mutant FN RMS cell lines. The molecular mechanism of the observed synergy was determined using conventional and capillary immunoassays. The efficacy and tolerability of trametinib\/ganitumab was assessed using a panel of RAS-mutated cell-line and patient-derived RMS xenograft models. Treatment with trametinib and ganitumab resulted in synergistic cellular growth inhibition in all cell lines tested and inhibition of tumor growth in four out of six models of RAS-mutant RMS. The combination was well tolerated in tumor-bearing SCID beige mice. Mechanistically, ganitumab treatment prevented the phosphorylation of AKT induced by MEK inhibition alone. Therapeutic response to the combination was observed in models without a mutation in the PI3K\/PTEN axis.

Objective: To conduct a meta-analysis to compare the diagnostic performance of 68Ga-FAPI PET\/CT and FDG PET\/CT in detecting PM based on studies providing head-to-head comparisons between the two tests. Evidence Acquisition: PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases were searched through July 2022 to identify studies reporting head-to-head comparison of 68Ga-FAPI PET\/CT and FDG PET\/CT for detection of PM. Reference standard was classified as histopathology in all patients, or as combination of histopathology, clinical, imaging, laboratory, and follow-up information (i.e., multidisciplinary reference standard). Random-effects statistical model was applied to conduct a meta-analysis of tests' diagnostic performances in patient-based and lesion-based analyses. QUADAS-2 and QUADAS-C tools were used to assess study quality. Evidence Synthesis: Eleven studies were included; patient-based analysis comprised nine studies with 340 patients, and lesion-based analysis comprised four studies with 222 lesions. Pooled sensitivity of 68Ga-FAPI PET\/CT was significantly higher than that of FDG PET\/CT in patient-based analysis [98.2% (95% CI: 96.1-100.0%) vs 55.9% (95% CI: 33.9-77.9%)] and lesion-based analysis [99.9% (95% CI: 99.5-100.0%) vs 27.3% (95% CI: 11.2-43.4%)]. Eight studies were rated as high risk of bias in the reference standard domain because the multidisciplinary reference standard was not sufficiently explained and may have included one of the two index tests, which would have artificially increased sensitivity. Specificity was reported in three studies as 100.0% for both tests; these studies were considered at uncertain risk of bias in the patient selection domain because patients with benign peritoneal conditions may have been excluded, resulting in underestimation of potential false-positive results. Conclusion: Current evidence suggests excellent sensitivity of 68Ga-FAPI PET\/CT for the detection of PM, in comparison to poorer sensitivity of FDG PET\/CT. However, most included studies had high risk of bias, with need for further studies that could more convincingly characterize true- and false-positive results.

Methods: This study entailed a retrospective post-hoc analysis of a prospective study that enrolled patients awaiting lung cancer resection surgery between March 2019 and February 2020. Eighty-one patients (38 men, 43 women; mean age, 60.5&#177;8.9 years; lobectomy in 43, limited resection in 38) were included. Patients underwent thoracic DECT and PFT evaluation preoperatively and 6 months postoperatively. Pulmonary lobes were segmented. Lobar volume and perfusion ratios (both relative to whole-lung values) were computed. Perfusion measures reflected DECT-derived iodine content. Patients completed 6-month postoperative quality-of-life (QOL) questionnaires. Results: Patients undergoing lobectomy, versus limited resection, exhibited greater increases in lung volume ratio of ipsilateral nonresected lobe(s) (42.3&#177;24.2% vs 22.9&#177;13.2%, p<.001) and of contralateral lung (14.6&#177;14.0% vs 6.4&#177;6.9%, p=.002), and greater increases in lung perfusion ratio of ipsilateral nonresected lobe(s) (39.9&#177;20.7% vs 22.8&#177;17.8%, p<.001) and of contralateral lung (20.9&#177;9.4% vs 4.3&#177;5.6%, p<.001). In patients with right lower lobe tumors, largest postoperative increases in lung volume ratio were in right middle lobe in those undergoing lobectomy (44.1&#177;21.0%) and limited resection (24.6&#177;14.5%), whereas largest postoperative increase in lung perfusion ratio was in left lower lobe in those undergoing lobectomy (53.9&#177;8.6%) and in right middle lobe in those undergoing limited resection (32.5&#177;24.1%). Otherwise, largest volume and perfusion ratio increases occurred in ipsilateral nonresected lobes (vs contralateral lobes) regardless of operative approach and lobar location.

We need a strong understanding of clock-coupled pathways in human tissues to better appreciate the links between disease and clock function. We developed a new computational approach to explore candidate pathways coupled to the clock in human tissues. This method, termed LTM, is an in silico screen to infer genetic influences on circadian clock function. LTM uses natural variation in gene expression in human data and directly links gene expression variation to clock strength independent of longitudinal data. We applied LTM to three human skin and one melanoma datasets and found that the cell cycle is the top candidate clock-coupled pathway in healthy skin. In addition, we applied LTM to thousands of tumor samples from 11 cancer types in the TCGA database and found that extracellular matrix organization-related pathways are tightly associated with the clock strength in humans. Further analysis shows that clock strength in tumor samples are correlated with the proportion of cancer-associated fibroblasts and endothelial cells. Therefore, we show both the power of LTM in predicting clock-coupled pathways and classify factors associated with clock strength in human tissues.

Two out of four studies have reported that the 64Arg allele was found more frequently in subjects with OAB than&#160;in healthy controls. A large study in a highly selective population (men undergoing prostatectomy for cancer treatment) did not confirm this. On the other hand, studies examining symptom severity typically found little difference between 64Arg and 64Trp carriers.

MicroRNAs (miRs) have been extensively studied as biomarkers in cancer and haematological disorders, and their expression has been correlated to the presence of recurrent molecular abnormalities, expression of oncogenes, as well as to prognosis\/clinical outcome. In the present study, expression signatures of different miRs related both to presence of myeloid\/lymphoid or mixed-lineage leukaemia 1 and Fms like tyrosine kinase 3 internal tandem duplications rearrangements and to the clinical outcome of paediatric patients with AML were identified. Notably, miR-221-3p and miR-222-3p resulted as a possible relapse-risk related miR. Thus, miR-221-3p and miR-222-3p expression modulation was investigated by using a Bromodomain&#8209;containing protein 4 (BRD4) inhibitor (JQ1) and a natural compound that acts as histone acetyl transferase inhibitor (curcumin), alone or in association, in order to decrease acetylation of histone tails and potentiate the effect of BRD4 inhibition.

According to our findings, the IC50 of H23 (KRAS mutant) cells is 2.99&#160;times lower than that of H1650 (non&#8209;KRAS mutant) cells. Flow cytometry and the Hoechst 33258 staining assay revealed that H1650 cells treated with 4&#160;&#181;g\/ml realgar had an apoptotic rate of 8.2%, while H23 cells had a rate of 21.46%. Accordingly, realgar was more sensitive to KRAS mutant cells. Transcriptome sequencing test indicated that there were 481 different expression genes in H23 cells treated with realgar. In H23 cells treated with realgar, mitochondria shrank, inner membrane folding was disturbed, and mitochondrial membrane potential crushed. Realgar boosted intracellular Fe2+, reactive oxygen species, malondialdehyde and glutathione levels, which were all reversed by ferroptosis inhibitor Fer&#8209;1. Realgar decreased phosphorylated p&#8209;Raf, p&#8209;ERK1\/2 and increased p&#8209;p38 and p&#8209;JNK, whereas only p&#8209;Raf was abolished by Fer&#8209;1.

Its target antigen was identified as the bromodomain&#8209;containing protein 2 (BRD2), a transcriptional regulator that plays a pivotal role in the transcriptional control of diverse genes. BRD2 was upregulated in HCC tissues of the H&#8209;ras12V&#8209;tg mouse and human subjects, as demonstrated using western blotting or immunohistochemical analysis, with the BRD2 autoantibody. In addition, the truncated BRD2 reactive to the BRD2 autoantibody was detected in tumor cell&#8209;derived exosomes, which possibly activated TA immune responses and the generation of autoantibodies. For the detection of the serum BRD2 autoantibody, epitope mimicries of autoantigenic BRD2 were screened from a random cyclic peptide CX7C library with the BRD2 autoantibody. A mimotope with the sequence of CTSVFLPHC, which was cyclized by one pair of cysteine residues, exhibited high affinity to the BRD2 autoantibody and competitively inhibited the binding of the autoantibody to the cellular BRD2 antigen. The use of this cyclic peptide as a capture antigen in human serum enzyme&#8209;linked immunosorbent assay allowed the distinction of patients with HCC from healthy subjects with 64.41% sensitivity and 82.42% specificity (area under the ROC curve, 0.7761), which is superior to serum alpha&#8209;fetoprotein (AFP; 35.83% sensitivity; 100% specificity; area under the ROC curve, 0.5337) for the diagnosis of HCC.

Recent research has indicated that the expression of multiple N6&#8209;methyladenosine (m6A) regulators is up&#8209; or downregulated in EC and that abnormalities in m6A methylation and the expression of associated regulators are critical to the pathogenesis and progression of EC. m6A is the most abundant internal modification of mRNA. Several studies have demonstrated a close association between the development and progression of malignant tumors and the epigenetic phenomenon of m6A methylation. In the present study, the current status of research on m6A methylation in EC was reviewed. The mechanisms of methyltransferase, demethylase and m6A binding protein in regulating the development and progression of EC by modifying mRNA were introduced. The related research results will provide novel methods and approaches for the prevention and treatment of EC.","query":"cancer"},"36321760":{"ArticleTitle":"STAT1- and NFAT-independent amplification of purinoceptor function integrates cellular senescence with interleukin-6 production in preadipocytes.","AbstractText":"Senescent preadipocytes promote adipose tissue dysfunction by secreting pro-inflammatory factors but little is known about the mechanisms regulating their production. We investigated if upregulated purinoceptor function sensitized senescent preadipocytes to cognate agonists and how such sensitization regulated inflammation. Etoposide was used to trigger senescence in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. CRISPR\/Cas9 technology or pharmacology allowed studies of transcription factor function. Fura-2 imaging was used for calcium measurements. Interleukin-6 levels were quantified using quantitative PCR and ELISA. Specific agonists and antagonists supported studies of purinoceptor coupling to interleukin-6 production. Experiments in MS1 VEGF angiosarcoma cells and adipose tissue samples from obese mice complemented preadipocyte experiments. 1. DNA damage-induced senescence robustly upregulated purinoceptor expression levels in preadipocytes and MS1 VEGF angiosarcoma cells. 2. ATP-evoked Ca2+ release was potentiated in senescent preadipocytes and ATP exposure enhanced interleukin-6 production, an effect mimicked by ADP but not UTP in a calcium-independent manner. 3. Senescence-associated upregulation and activation of the adenosine A3 receptor also enhanced interleukin-6 production. 4. Nucleotide hydrolysis was not essential because exposure to ATP&#947;S also enhanced interleukin-6 secretion. 5. Pharmacological experiments suggested coupling of P2X ion channels and P2Y12 -P2Y13 receptors to downstream interleukin-6 production. 6. Interleukin-6 signaling exacerbated inflammation during senescence and compromised adipogenesis. We report a previously uncharacterized link between cellular senescence and purinergic signaling in preadipocytes and endothelial cancer cells, raising the possibility that upregulated purinoceptors play key modulatory roles in senescence-associated conditions like obesity and cancer. There is potential for exploitation of specific purinoceptor antagonists as therapeutics in inflammatory disorders.","query":"cancer"},"36321747":{"ArticleTitle":"Tailored point-of-care biosensors for liquid biopsy in the field of oncology.","AbstractText":"In the field of cancer detection, technologies to analyze tumors using biomarkers circulating in fluids such as blood have developed rapidly based on liquid biopsy. A proactive approach to early cancer detection can lead to more effective treatments with minimal side effects and better long-term patient survival. However, early detection of cancer is hindered by the existing limitations of conventional cancer diagnostic methods. To enable early diagnosis and regular monitoring and improve automation, the development of integrated point-of-care (POC) and biosensors is needed. This is expected to fundamentally change the diagnosis, management, and monitoring of response to treatment of cancer. POC-based techniques will provide a way to avoid complications that occur after invasive tissue biopsy, such as bleeding, infection, and pain. The aim of this study is to provide a comprehensive view of biosensors and their clinical relevance in oncology for the detection of biomarkers with liquid biopsies of proteins, miRNA, ctDNA, exosomes, and cancer cells. The preceding discussion also illustrates the changing landscape of liquid biopsy-based cancer diagnosis through nanomaterials, machine learning, artificial intelligence, wearable devices, and sensors, many of which apply POC design principles. With the advent of sensitive, selective, and timely detection of cancer, we see the field of POC technology for cancer detection and treatment undergoing a positive paradigm shift in the foreseeable future.","query":"cancer"},"36321745":{"ArticleTitle":"Real-world utility of early measurable residual disease assessments by multi-parametric flow cytometry in adult patients with B-lymphoblastic leukemia receiving Hyper-CVAD induction chemotherapy.","AbstractText":"Multi-parametric flow cytometry (MFC) has a well-established role in measurable residual disease (MRD) monitoring in patients with B-lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). However, the optimal time-point (TP) for early MRD testing and associated prognostic impact remain undefined in adult B-ALL patients receiving Hyper-CVAD induction chemotherapy. To evaluate the utility of MRD analysis after one cycle (TP1) in comparison to MRD analysis after two cycles (TP2) of induction treatment with Hyper-CVAD chemotherapy, we studied 49 adult B-ALL patients over a 10-year period (2010-2020) who had available bone marrow samples for morphological and MFC MRD assessments at the two separate TP. Median times to TP1 and TP2 relative to start of treatment were 21 and 45&#8201;days, respectively. When censored at transplant, achievement of MRD negativity at TP1 was not associated with a statistically significant improvement in either EFS (p&#160;=&#160;0.426) or OS (p&#160;=&#160;0.335) when compared to patients with MRD positivity.

This pilot study aims to explore epigenetic changes (epigenetic age and differentially methylated genes) in patients before and after autologous HCT, that can serve as potential biomarkers to better predict HCT outcomes. This study used a prospective longitudinal study design to compare genome wide DNA methylation changes in 36 autologous HCT eligible patients recruited from the Cellular Immunotherapies and Transplant clinic at a designated National Cancer Center. Genome-wide DNA methylation, measured by the Illumina Infinium Human Methylation 850K BeadChip, showed a significant difference in DNA methylation patterns post-HCT compared to pre-HCT. Compared to baseline levels of DNA methylation pre-HCT, 3358 CpG sites were hypo-methylated and 3687 were hyper-methylated. Identified differentially methylated positions overlapped with genes involved in hematopoiesis, blood cancers, inflammation and immune responses. Enrichment analyses showed significant alterations in biological processes such as immune response and cell structure organization, however no significant pathways were noted. Though participants had an advanced epigenetic age compared to chronologic age before and after HCT, both epigenetic age and accelerated age decreased post-HCT. Epigenetic changes, both in epigenetic age and differentially methylated genes were observed in autologous HCT recipients, and should be explored as biomarkers to predict transplant outcomes after autologous HCT in larger, longitudinal studies.","query":"cancer"},"36321691":{"ArticleTitle":"R-spondin 3 deletion induces Erk phosphorylation to enhance Wnt signaling and promote bone formation in the appendicular skeleton.","AbstractText":"Activation of Wnt signaling leads to high bone density.

Here we investigated the role of Rspo3 in skeletal homeostasis in mice. Using a comprehensive set of mouse genetic and mechanistic studies, we show that in the appendicular skeleton, Rspo3 haplo-insufficiency and Rspo3 targeted deletion in Runx2+ osteoprogenitors lead to an increase in trabecular bone mass, with increased number of osteoblasts and bone formation. In contrast and highlighting the complexity of Wnt signaling in the regulation of skeletal homeostasis, we show that Rspo3 deletion in osteoprogenitors results in the opposite phenotype in the axial skeleton, i.e., low vertebral trabecular bone mass. Mechanistically, Rspo3 deficiency impairs the inhibitory effect of Dkk1 on Wnt signaling activation and bone mass. We demonstrate that Rspo3 deficiency leads to activation of Erk signaling which in turn, stabilizes b-catenin and Wnt signaling activation. Our data demonstrate that Rspo3 haplo-insufficiency\/deficiency boosts canonical Wnt signaling by activating Erk signaling, to favor osteoblastogenesis, bone formation and bone mass.","query":"cancer"},"36321685":{"ArticleTitle":"Raising Immunization Rates Among Cancer Patients.","AbstractText":"","query":"cancer"},"36321670":{"ArticleTitle":"Aberrant Expression of Thymosin Beta-4 Correlates With Advanced Disease and BRAF V600E Mutation in Thyroid Cancer.","AbstractText":"Thymosin beta-4 (TMSB4X) was recently identified as a differentially expressed gene between malignant and non-malignant thyroid cells via single-cell RNA sequencing.

Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that normal thyroid tissue or benign thyroid disorders exhibited undetectable immunoreactivity against TMSB4X except for positive staining of inflammatory infiltrates and stromal cells associated with autoimmune thyroid disease. By contrast, overexpression of TMSB4X was observed in a variety of thyroid malignancies, including papillary, follicular, poorly differentiated, and undifferentiated thyroid cancer.

The combination of photothermal and immunotherapy has proven to be a promising method to conquer technical challenges. Inhibiting the programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1)\/programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) immune pathway represents one of the most successful immunotherapy strategies. Whereas, the PD-L1 expression level significantly differs, leading to a relatively low response rate to the immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) approaches. Therefore, improving the expression level of PD-L1 becomes one potential method to enhance the response rate. Herein, NIH 3T3 cells were educated to steadily express PD-1 protein. Furthermore, the synthesized molybdenum nitride was then coated with PD-1 protein-modified cytomembrane, which endows it with immune checkpoint blocking capability. Moreover, under the irradiation of near-infrared light, the local mild heat released from the molybdenum nitride causes the apoptosis of tumor cells. More importantly, the elevated temperature simultaneously helps elevate the expression level of PD-L1, further enhancing the response rate of ICB. Finally, the PD-1 cytomembrane coatings interact with the upregulated PD-L1, leading to the activation of the immune system. In summary, we confirmed that the PD-1 protein-coated molybdenum nitride could synergistically ablate tumors and avoid metastasis.","query":"cancer"},"36321627":{"ArticleTitle":"Metal complexes of a pro-vitamin K3 analog phthiocol (2-hydroxy-3-methylnaphthalene-1,4-dione): synthesis, characterization, and anticancer activity.","AbstractText":"The hydroxy analog of vitamin K3 (2-methylnaphthalene-1,4-dione) is known as phthiocol (2-hydroxy-3-methylnaphthalene-1,4-dione; pht).

A Na(I) complex of phthiocol, Na(pht), is isolated as a polymer. The ligand phthiocol and the complexes Na(pht), 1, 1A, and 3 crystallize in a monoclinic crystal system. X-ray structures reveal that the bond distances of coordinated phthiocol ligands are in the reduced naphthosemiquinone form in the complexes synthesized at 0 &#176;C. The metal complexes of phthiocol (pht) were evaluated for their anticancer activity against MCF-7 (breast) and A549 (lung) cancer cell lines.

Facial neoplasms may present overlapping clinical and dermoscopic findings. Our goal was to evaluate and compare, via reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM), follicular involvement in facial neoplasms. We retrospectively searched our image database, between January 2008 to December 2020, for all facial lesions with (1) a standardized set of clinical, dermoscopic and RCM images, and (2) a biopsy-proven diagnosis of lentigo maligna\/lentigo maligna melanoma (LM\/LMM, n=39), basal cell carcinoma (BCC, n=51), squamous cell carcinoma in situ (SCCIS, n=5), actinic keratosis (AK, n=11) and lichen-planus-like keratosis (LPLK, n=18). Two readers jointly evaluated the RCM images for a set of predefined features of follicular involvement. Diffuse obliteration of follicles was frequent in BCC (88%), while follicular infiltration by refractile dendritic cells and\/or by bright round nucleated cells was common in melanoma (90% and 44%, respectively). Extension of atypical keratinocytes down follicles was more prominent among SCCIS than AK (80% vs. 45%, p=0.01). In most LPLK (89%), there was follicular sparing. Evaluation of RCM criteria centering on the follicles can be useful in the differential diagnosis between common facial neoplasms. This article is protected by copyright.

The DCE-MRI data acquired in women with invasive breast cancer (N&#160;=&#160;27) were used to retrospectively compare parameter maps fit to full and subsampled time courses. Simplicial complexes were generated for a fixed range of Kety-Tofts model parameters and for the parameter ranges weighted by estimates from the fully sampled data. The largest-area manifolds determined the optimal three time points for each case. Simulations were performed along with retrospectively subsampled data fits. The agreement was computed between the model parameters fit to three points and those fit to all points. The optimal three-point sample times were from the data-informed simplicial complex analysis and determined to be 65, 204, and 393&#8201;s after arrival of the contrast agent to breast tissue. In the patient data, tumor-median parameter values fit using all points and the three selected time points agreed with concordance correlation coefficients of 0.97 for Ktrans and 0.67 for ve . It is possible to accurately estimate pharmacokinetic parameters from three properly selected time points inserted into a clinical DCE-MRI breast exam.

Metastasis is a serious influencing factor for poor treatment effect and shortened survival in lung cancer. But the complicated underlying molecular mechanisms of tumour metastasis remain unclear. In this review, we aim to further summarize and explore the underlying mechanisms of tumour-derived exosomes (TDEs) in lung cancer metastasis. TDEs are actively produced and released by tumour cells and carry messages from tumour cells to normal or abnormal cells residing at close or distant sites. Many studies have shown that TDEs promote lung cancer metastasis and development through multiple mechanisms, including epithelial-mesenchymal transition, immunosuppression and the formation of a premetastatic niche. TDEs regulate these mechanisms to promote metastasis by carrying DNA, proteins, miRNA, mRNA, lncRNA and ceRNA. Further exploring TDEs related to metastasis may be a promising treatment strategy and deserve further investigation. Overall, TDEs play a critical role in metastatic of lung cancer. Further studies are needed to explore the underlying mechanisms of TDEs in lung cancer metastasis.","query":"cancer"},"36321561":{"ArticleTitle":"Intestinal Apc-inactivation induces HSP25 dependency.","AbstractText":"The majority of colorectal cancers (CRCs) present with early mutations in tumor suppressor gene APC. APC mutations result in oncogenic activation of the Wnt pathway, which is associated with hyperproliferation, cytoskeletal remodeling, and a global increase in mRNA translation. To compensate for the increased biosynthetic demand, cancer cells critically depend on protein chaperones to maintain proteostasis, although their function in CRC remains largely unexplored. In order to investigate the role of molecular chaperones in driving CRC initiation, we captured the transcriptomic profiles of murine wild type and Apc-mutant organoids during active transformation. We discovered a strong transcriptional upregulation of Hspb1, which encodes small heat shock protein 25 (HSP25). We reveal an indispensable role for HSP25 in facilitating Apc-driven transformation, using both in&#160;vitro organoid cultures and mouse models, and demonstrate that chemical inhibition of HSP25 using brivudine reduces the development of premalignant adenomas. These findings uncover a hitherto unknown vulnerability in intestinal transformation that could be exploited for the development of chemopreventive strategies in high-risk individuals.","query":"cancer"},"36321559":{"ArticleTitle":"The prevalence of chronic diseases in international immigrants: a systematic review and meta-analysis.","AbstractText":"The purpose of this study is systematically to review and synthesise available prevalence data of major chronic diseases in international immigrants.

Here, we found that long-term metformin exposure led to metabolic adaptation of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells, which was characterized by an obvious epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotype and compensatory elevation of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). TOMM34, a translocase of the outer mitochondrial membrane, was upregulated to promote tumor metastasis in response to metformin-induced metabolic stress. Mechanistically, TOMM34 interacted with ATP5B to preserve F1 FO -ATPase activity, which conferred mitochondrial OXPHOS and ATP production. This metabolic preference for OXPHOS suggested a large requirement of energy supply by cancer cells to survive and spread in response to therapeutic stress. Notably, disturbing the interaction between TOMM34 and ATP5B using Gboxin, a specific OXPHOS inhibitor, increased sensitivity to metformin and suppressed tumor progression both in&#160;vitro and in&#160;vivo. Overall, this study demonstrates a molecular link of the TOMM34\/ATP5B-ATP synthesis axis during metformin adaptation and provides promising therapeutic targets for metformin sensitization in cancer treatment.","query":"cancer"},"36321552":{"ArticleTitle":"A functional analysis of 180 cancer cell lines reveals conserved intrinsic metabolic programs.","AbstractText":"Cancer cells reprogram their metabolism to support growth and invasion.

To characterize the metabolic lifestyle of cancer cells across pathways and genotypes, we profiled the intracellular metabolome of 180 pan-cancer cell lines grown in identical conditions. For each cell line, we estimated activity for 49 pathways spanning the entirety of the metabolic network. Upon clustering, we discovered a convergence into only two major metabolic types. These were functionally confirmed by 13 C-flux analysis, lipidomics, and analysis of sensitivity to perturbations. They revealed that the major differences in cancers are associated with lipid, TCA cycle, and carbohydrate metabolism. Thorough integration of these types with multiomics highlighted little association with genetic alterations but a strong association with markers of epithelial-mesenchymal transition.

Among other advantages, these methods are usually praised for delivering a treatment measure that can easily handle multiple outcomes of different nature, while keeping a meaningful interpretation for patients and clinicians. For time-to-event outcomes, a recent suggestion emerged in the literature for estimating these treatment measures by providing a natural handling of censored outcomes. However, this estimation procedure may lead to biased estimates when tails of survival functions cannot be reliably estimated using Kaplan-Meier estimators. The problem then extrapolates to the other outcomes incorporated in the pairwise comparison construction. In this work, we suggest to extend the procedure by the consideration of a hybrid survival function estimator that relies on an extreme value tail model through the Generalized Pareto distribution.

Furthermore, our results suggested that POR overexpression promoted TAM resistance by activating the STAT1\/c-Myc pathway in ER-positive breast cancer cells. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that high POR\/STAT1 expression was correlated with poor prognosis in TAM-treated breast cancer patients.

Saponins from Platycodi radix (SPR) and microRNAs (miRNAs) have been reported to regulate CRC cell progression. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) detected miR-181c-5p, miR-181d-5p, and RBM47 expression level. Cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8), 5-ethynyl-20-deoxyuridine (EdU), colony formation, transwell, and wound healing assays validated that miR-181c-5p and miR-181d-5p promote CRC cell proliferation, migration and invasion and SPR exerts opposite effects. Cignal Finder Reporter Array and western blot proved that the activity of PI3K\/AKT pathway was decreased by RBM47 overexpression. RNA pulldown, luciferase reporter, and RNA-binding protein immunoprecipitation (RIP) assays proved the interaction between miR-181c\/d-5p and RBM47, and RBM47 and PTEN. Rescue experiments were carried out to validate that RBM47 reverses the influence of miR-181c\/d-5p on the progression of CRC cells. The stability of PTEN was probed by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction in CRC cells treated with Actinomycin D (Act D). To be concluded, SPR inactivates PI3K\/AKT signaling pathway to suppress CRC cell proliferation, invasion, and migration via miR-181c\/d-5p\/RBM47.

Recently, GATOR1 (Gap Activity TOward Rags 1) complexes have been shown to play an important role in regulating tumor growth. NPRL2 is a critical component of the GATOR1 complex. Therefore, this study used NPRL2 knockdown to investigate how GATORC1 regulates the prognosis and development of HCC via the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and autophagy signaling pathways. We established HepG2 cells with NPRL2 knockdown using small interfering RNA (siRNA) and short hairpin RNA (shRNA) systems. The siRNA-mediated and shRNA-mediated NPRL2 down-regulation significantly reduced the expression of NPRL2 and two other GATPOR1 complex components, NPRL3 and DEPDC5, in HepG2 cells; furthermore, the efficient down-regulation of NPRL2 protein expression by both the shRNA and siRNA systems enhanced the proliferation, migration, and colony formation in vitro. Additionally, the NPRL2 down-regulation significantly increased HCC growth in the subcutaneous and orthotopic xenograft mouse models. The NPRL2 down-regulation increased the Rag GTPases and mTOR activation and inhibited autophagy in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, the NPRL2 level in the tumors was significantly associated with mortality, recurrence, the serum alpha fetoprotein level, the tumor size, the American Joint Committee on Cancer stage, and the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage. Low NPRL2, NPRL3, DEPDC5, and LC3, and high p62 and mTOR protein expression in the tumors was significantly associated with disease-free survival and overall survival in 300 patients with HCC after surgical resection. Conclusion: The efficient down-regulation of NPRL2 significantly increased HCC proliferation, migration, and colony formation in vitro, and increased HCC growth in vivo. Low NPRL2 protein expression in the tumors was closely correlated with poorer clinical outcomes in patients with HCC. These results provide a mechanistic understanding of HCC and aid the development of treatments for HCC.","query":"cancer"},"36321400":{"ArticleTitle":"What doesn't kill you makes you stronger - bcl-2 promotes survival independent of proliferation.","AbstractText":"","query":"cancer"},"36321395":{"ArticleTitle":"Cardiovascular Risk Assessment and Management for Pediatricians.","AbstractText":"Childhood and adolescence provide a unique window of opportunity to prevent atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease later in life, especially for pediatric groups at risk.

Here, we focus on recent advances in cardiovascular risk assessment and management and their implications for pediatric practice. First, hyperlipidemia and hyperglycemia are highly prevalent in the young, with hyperlipidemia occurring in 14.6% and hyperglycemia in 16.4% of children and adolescents with a normal weight. Implementation of nonfasting lipid and glycated hemoglobin screening in youth at risk is emerging as a promising avenue to improve testing compliance and lipid and glucose management. Second, blood pressure, lipid, and glucose management in youth at risk are reviewed in depth. Third, multisite and multimodal assessment of early atherosclerosis is discussed as a way to capture the complexity of atherosclerosis as a systemic disease. In addition to conventional carotid intima-media thickness measurements, the measurement of aortic pulse wave velocity and peripheral arterial tonometry can advance the assessment of early atherosclerosis in pediatrics.

Although permanent stoma often results from severe bowel dysfunction and significantly impacts quality of life, the presence of stoma paradoxically excludes patients from functional follow-up. Hence, stoma status is rarely reported along with LARS, while assessment of both is essential for the comprehensive evaluation of bowel dysfunction in long-term survivors of rectal cancer. Patients enrolled into the Neoadjuvant FOLFOX6 Chemotherapy with or without Radiation in Rectal Cancer (FOWARC) multicentre randomized clinical trial were randomized to receive long-course neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT) or chemotherapy (nCT) followed by sphincter-saving proctectomy and longitudinal follow-up. The primary outcome of the trial was disease-free survival. LARS score and stoma status were assessed secondarily for postoperative bowel function in the largest single-centre cohort of the trial. Overall, 327 patients with locally advanced rectal cancer were enrolled in the original trial and 203 responded after a median follow-up of 83.4 months, of whom 24 (11.8 per cent) had persistent stoma, and 48 patients (23.6 per cent) reported major LARS. Compared with the nCT group, the nCRT group reported more persistent stomas (16.5 per cent versus 4.9 per cent, P = 0.014), and more major LARS in patients without persistent stoma (34.7 per cent versus 16.7 per cent, P = 0.003). The combined prevalence of persistent stoma and major LARS was significantly higher in the nCRT group (45.5 per cent versus 20.7 per cent, P < 0.001).

NR2E1 and its interacting protein-LSD1 in BTICs were studied by gene interference combined with cell growth, tumour sphere formation, co-immunoprecipitation and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. NR2E1 interacting peptide of LSD1 was identified by Amide Hydrogen\/Deuterium Exchange and Mass Spectrometry (HDX-MS) and analysed by in vitro functional assays. The in vivo function of the peptide was examined with intracranial mouse model by transplanting patient-derived BTICs. We found NR2E1 recruits LSD1, a lysine demethylase, to demethylate mono- and di-methylated histone 3 Lys4 (H3K4me\/me2) at the Pten promoter and repress its expression, thereby promoting BTIC proliferation. Using Amide Hydrogen\/Deuterium Exchange and Mass Spectrometry (HDX-MS) method, we identified four LSD1 peptides that may interact with NR2E1.

By contrast, metals possess advantageous functional properties, including high mechanical strength and conductivity, that are desirable across several applications within biomedicine. To realize actively-triggerable metals, we leveraged a mechanism called liquid metal embrittlement, in which certain liquid metals penetrate the grain boundaries of certain solid metals and cause them to dramatically weaken or disintegrate.

This strategy has several potential drawbacks, including irregular target delineation for SRS and potential tumor \"seeding\" away from the resection cavity during surgery. A neoadjuvant (preoperative) approach to radiation therapy avoids these limitations and offers improved patient convenience. This study assessed the efficacy of neoadjuvant SRS as a new treatment paradigm for patients with brain metastases. A retrospective review was performed at a single institution to identify patients who had undergone neoadjuvant SRS (specifically, Gamma Knife radiosurgery) followed by resection of a brain metastasis. Kaplan-Meier survival and log-rank analyses were used to evaluate risks of progression and death. Assessments were made of local recurrence and leptomeningeal spread. Additionally, an analysis of the contemporary literature of postoperative and neoadjuvant SRS for metastatic disease was performed. Twenty-four patients who had undergone neoadjuvant SRS followed by resection of a brain metastasis were identified in the single-institution cohort. The median age was 64 years (range 32-84 years), and the median follow-up time was 16.5 months (range 1 month to 5.7 years). The median radiation dose was 17 Gy prescribed to the 50% isodose. Rates of local disease control were 100% at 6 months, 87.6% at 12 months, and 73.5% at 24 months. In 4 patients who had local treatment failure, salvage therapy included repeat resection, laser interstitial thermal therapy, or repeat SRS. One hundred thirty patients (including the current cohort) were identified in the literature who had been treated with neoadjuvant SRS prior to resection. Overall rates of local control at 1 year after neoadjuvant SRS treatment ranged from 49% to 91%, and rates of leptomeningeal dissemination from 0% to 16%. In comparison, rates of local control 1 year after postoperative SRS ranged from 27% to 91%, with 7% to 28% developing leptomeningeal disease. Neoadjuvant SRS for the treatment of brain metastases is a novel approach that mitigates the shortcomings of postoperative SRS. While additional prospective studies are needed, the current study of 130 patients including the summary of 106 previously published cases supports the safety and potential efficacy of preoperative SRS with potential for improved outcomes compared with postoperative SRS.","query":"cancer"},"36321290":{"ArticleTitle":"A quantitative and comparative evaluation of stereotactic spine radiosurgery local control: proposing a consistent measurement methodology.","AbstractText":"Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) is a precise and conformal treatment modality used in the management of metastatic spine tumors.

This study presents radiographic local control rates post-SBRT, systematically compares measurements acquired according to WHO and Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria, and explores the relationship to patient outcome. The authors performed a retrospective review of prospectively obtained data from a cohort of 59 consecutive patients (81 metastatic isocenters) treated with SBRT and followed with serial MRI scans. Measurements were performed by a neuroradiologist blinded to the patients' clinical course. Local control status was determined according to both WHO and RECIST measurements, and agreement between the measuring methodologies was calculated and reported. Eighty-one isocenters (111 vertebral bodies) were treated with SBRT. The mean treatment dose was 13.96 Gy and the median follow-up duration was 10.8 months, during which 408 MRI scans were evaluated with both WHO and RECIST criteria for each scan point. Imaging demonstrated a mean unidimensional size decrease of 0.2 cm (p = 0.14) and a mean area size decrease of 0.99 cm2 (p = 0.03). Although 88% of the case classifications were concordant and the agreement was significant, WHO criteria were found to be more sensitive to tumor size change. The local control rates according to WHO and RECIST were 95% and 98%, respectively. Although WHO volumetric measurements are admittedly superior for tumor size measurement, RECIST is simpler, reproducible, and for the first time is shown here to be comparable to WHO criteria. Thus, the application of RECIST methodology appears to be a suitable standard for evaluating post-SBRT treatment response.

We presented an unsupervised learning framework for the transferring from the identity mapping to the low-dose recontruction task, called Marginal Distribution Adaptation in Multi-scale (MDAM). For NDCTs as source domain data, MDAM is an identity map with two parts: firstly, it establishes a dimensionality reduction mapping, which can obtain the same feature distribution from NDCTs and LDCTs; and then NDCTs is retrieved by reconstructing the image overview and details from the low-dimensional features. For the purpose of the feature transfer between source domain and target domain (LDCTs), we introduce the multi-scale feature extraction in the MDAM, and then eliminate differences in probability distributions of these multi-scale features between NDCTs and LDCTs through wavelet decomposition and domain adaptation&#160;learning.

The targets were selected based on an analysis of relevant literature, and the 3D structures of the selected receptors were obtained in.pdb format from the RCSB-Protein data bank (PDB, http:\/\/www.rscb.org\/pdb). Based on a review of the literature, sixty plant secondary metabolites, or plant phenolics, were selected. The ligand structures were obtained and downloaded in.sdf format from the NCBI PubChem chemicals database (https:\/\/pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/). Molecular docking between the receptor and ligands was accomplished using the Molegro Virtual Docker 6.0 (MVD) software. The target RAF1, BRAF chain 1, TIE2 chain 2 FGFR1, FGFR2, AXL, and FGFR4 showed the best binding effectiveness with acteoside compared to their respective positive control. RET chain 1 and BRAF chain 2 acteoside showed prominent binding efficacy after Curcumin, and Epigallocatechingallate respectively against positive control. Present findings clearly pointing towards the potentiality of acteoside in inhibiting various HCC targets. Acteoside, may be used as a prominent lead molecule in the future treatment of hepatic cancer with its multifaceted binding efficiencies against various target proteins.","query":"cancer"},"36321227":{"ArticleTitle":"The Determination of Molecular and Toxicological Mechanisms of Cucurbitacine E in Model Organism Drosophila melanogaster and Various Cancer Cell Lines: Molecular modelling, docking and dynamic simulation studies.","AbstractText":"Cucurbitacins are one of the most important components of Ecballium elaterium. Among the cucurbitacins, Cucurbitacin E was the first to be isolated. This study focused on screening the anticancer and insecticidal potential of Cucurbitacin E by the in-vitro, in-vivo, and in-silico methods. In the study, toxicity analysis of Cucurbitacin E were determined on HeLa, Caco 2 cancer cell lines and D. melanogaster. While the expression levels of the BAD, BCL-2, AKT-1 and H-purine genes of cancer cell lines were determined, the CG15530, BUFFY, AKT-1 and Purine genes of D. melanogaster were determined by RT-PCR. Besides, molecular docking and dynamic properties of Cucurbitacin E with human and insectoid enzymes were presented in silico. The IC50 value of Cucurbitacin E in the HeLa ovarian and Caco 2 colon cancer cell lines was determined to be 42 ug\/ml and 85 ug\/ml, respectively. The LC50 and LC99 doses for fruit flies were determined to be 47,693 &#181;g\/ml and 133,251 &#181;g\/ml, respectively. Gene expression analysis revealed that Cucurbitacin E showed the greatest effect on Purine and AKT-1 genes in D. melanogaster. We analyzed all genes by Western blot, but we did not detect significant changes in genes other than H-purine. In silico studies revealed that the Purine protein of D. melanogaster had the highest bonding energy with Cucurbitacin E as a ligand. Similarly, Cucurbitacin E showed great affinity towards H-purine (-10.2 kcal\/mol). Molecular dynamics simulation studies were also performed to determine the stability of the dynamic process. As a result of our in vivo, in vitro and bioinformatic analyzes, it has been seen that Cucurbitacine E is effective against the cancer types and model insect studied.","query":"cancer"},"36321226":{"ArticleTitle":"Identification of multi-kinase allosteric inhibitors of oncogenic targets EGFR1, PI3 & BRAF Kinase.","AbstractText":"To identify promising allosteric inhibitors with the potential to inhibit EGFR1, PI3K, and BRAF kinase as a single agent or in a combination of existing drugs, thus acting as a therapeutic option when traditional drugs fail to give a beneficial response in disease pathology. Upregulation of EGFR1 activates several downstream signaling pathways, resulting in pathophysiological alterations that contribute to cancer. The RAS\/RAF\/MEK\/ERK (MAPK) and PI3K\/Akt\/mTOR (PI3K\/Akt\/mTOR) pathways are major downstream signalling partners induced by EGFR1 activation. Despite their vast importance, allosteric FDA-approved drugs targeting EGFR1 and these pathways are not available. To identify novel multi-kinase small molecules with the potential to inhibit major sites of amplification of cancer signalling pathways i.e., EGFR1, PI3K\/Akt\/mTOR, and RAS\/RAF\/MEK\/ERK (MAPK) signalling pathways targeting allosteric sites. In silico methods were used to identify the potential inhibitors using EGFR1, PI3 kinase, and BRAF kinase crystal structures complexed with allosteric inhibitors. The potential novel molecules were confirmed for their drug-likeness. Their stability of binding was also confirmed using molecular dynamics simulation studies. To eliminate false negatives, this study used a pharmacophore and structure-based targeting method. The current study was effective in identifying druglike small molecules: ZINC38783966, ZINC01456629, ZINC01456628, and 124173751, 137352549, 137353176, 137352399, 132020316 from ZINC and PubChem database respectively with a potential to bind EGFR1 (6DUK), PI3Kinase (4A55) and BRAF (6P3D) at allosteric sites. A 50 ns molecular dynamics investigation also revealed that these potential novel multitarget kinase allosteric inhibitors exhibited stable binding. EGFR1, PI3K\/Akt\/mTOR, and RAS\/RAF\/MEK\/ERK (MAPK) signalling pathways alternation is observed in cancers in high frequency and are also used by viral and environmental toxicants for pathologic purposes. These multi-kinase allosteric inhibitors will stimulate novel ideas for allosteric drug discovery and deepen our understanding of targeting these pathways either singly or in a combination of orthosteric inhibitors.","query":"cancer"},"36321209":{"ArticleTitle":"Sources of Nutrition Advice and Desired Nutrition Guidance in Oncology Care: Patient's Perspectives.","AbstractText":"To describe the proportion of cancer patients and survivors who receive nutrition advice, the sources of that advice, and to explore the nutrition advice this cohort would like to have received.

Women in the intervention arm underwent three rounds of CBE every 3 years. CBE-positive women were reexamined by a physician, and triple-assessment was performed on those confirmed to have abnormalities. All participants were followed through home visits and linkage with population-based cancer registry. Of the 55,843 eligible women in the intervention arm, 95.7% had CBE at least once and 11.5% were CBE-positive. Breast cancers were diagnosed in 335 participants in the intervention group and 273 in the control group (N&#160;=&#160;59,447). Age-standardized incidence rate of early cancer was 30.4 of 100,000 in the intervention and 21.9 of 100,000 in the control group, with a rate ratio (RR) of 1.4 (95%&#160;confidence interval [CI], 1.1-1.8).

To date, no efficient treatment is available for GBC patients. Based on the data from cBioPortal, TIMER, and GDSC, we performed an unbiased screening with 25 candidate compounds that predominantly target ErbB family and identified HKI-272, a highly selective EGFR\/ErbB2 inhibitor, displayed decreased IC50 values in three GBC cell lines. HKI-272 not only promoted gemcitabine-mediated anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects and induced cell cycle arrest in GBC, but also enhanced gemcitabine-induced suppressive effects of GBC cell migration and invasion by inhibiting pathways downstream of EGFR. Furthermore, HKI-272, together with gemcitabine, effectively suppressed tumor growth and metastases in mouse models. Immunostaining and HE staining data from both primary tumor and lung metastasis indicated that the anti-proliferative and anti-metastatic effects were mediated through EGFR suppression. Moreover, the expression of EGFR, measured by both immunostaining and HE staining, was correlated with a poor prognosis in GBC. In addition, EGFR in tumor tissues are independent indicators for overall survival in GBC patients.

NAFLD has various presentations, including fatigue, unexplained weight loss, bloating, upper abdominal pain, decreased appetite, headache, anxiety, poor sleep, increased thirst, palpitation, and a feeling of warmth. Some studies have shown that NAFLD with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has poor outcomes. The gold standard for NAFLD diagnosis is liver biopsy. Other diagnostic tools are imaging tests, serum biomarkers, microbiota markers, and tests for extrahepatic complications. There are no specific treatments for NAFLD. Therefore, the main concern for NAFLD is treating the comorbid conditions such as anti-diabetic agents for type 2 diabetes mellitus, statins to reduce HCC progression, antioxidants to prevent hepatocellular damage, and bariatric surgery for patients with a BMI&#160;of >40 kg\/m2 and >35 kg\/m2 with comorbidities. Lifestyle and dietary changes are considered preventive strategies against NAFLD advancement. Inadequate treatment of NAFLD further leads to cardiac consequences, sleep apnea, chronic kidney disease, and inflammatory bowel disease. In this systematic review, we have briefly discussed the risk factors, pathogenesis, clinical features, and numerous consequences of NAFLD. We have also reviewed various guidelines for NAFLD diagnosis along with existing therapeutic strategies for the management and prevention of the disease.","query":"cancer"},"36320942":{"ArticleTitle":"Electronic Cigarettes for Smoking Cessation: The Gap Between Behavior in Smokers and Medical Education.","AbstractText":"E-cigarettes have engendered a great deal of controversy within the public health and medical communities.&#160; Methods: Two cross-sectional surveys were administered. First, patients at an annual lung cancer screening appointment who&#160;self-identified as former smokers were asked about strategies for achieving and maintaining smoking cessation with open-ended questions. Second, medical students at a single university reported their opinion and knowledge of combustible cigarettes and e-cigarettes. Among the n=102 in the patient survey indicating that they used e-cigarettes or over-the-counter (OTC) nicotine replacement products&#160;for smoking cessation, 34.3% (35\/102) vaped e-cigarettes, making it the second most common next to patches (47.1% {48\/102}). By comparison, n=48 reported using medication. Medical student participants (n=168) were mixed regarding whether a patient should switch from traditional to electronic cigarettes (56.0% yes; 44.0% no) and reported receiving education about traditional cigarettes (92.3%) at a much higher rate than for e-cigarettes (46.4%), p<.001. Many former heavy smokers undergoing a lung cancer screen used e-cigarettes to achieve smoking cessation.

Recently, a novel AI algorithm for the characterization of polyps was developed by NEC Corporation (Japan). The aim of our study is to perform an external validation of this algorithm. The study was a video-based evaluation of the computer-aided diagnosis (CADx) system. Patients undergoing colonoscopy were recruited to record videos of colonic polyps. The frozen polyp images extracted from these videos were used for real-time histological prediction by the endoscopists and by the CADx system, and the results were compared. A total of 115 polyp images were extracted from 66 patients. Sensitivity, negative predictive value&#160;and accuracy for diminutive polyps on white light imaging (WLI) and image-enhanced endoscopy (IEE) when assessed by CADx was 90.9% [95% confidence interval (CI) 77.3-100] and 95.8% [95% CI 87.5-100], 80% [95% CI 44.4-97.5] and 90.9% [95% CI 58.7-99.8], 84.8% [95% CI 72.7-97] and 84.6% [95%CI 71.8-94.9], respectively, compared to 48.1% [95%CI 37.7-59.1] and 72% [95% CI 62.5-81], 37.5% [95% CI 28.8-46.8] and 55% [95% CI 44.7-65.0], 53.7% [95% CI 44.2-63.2] and 66.7% [95% CI 59.7-73.3] when assessed by endoscopists. Concordance between histology and CADx-based post-polypectomy surveillance intervals was 93.02% on WLI and 96% on IEE. AI-based optical diagnosis is promising and has the potential to be better than the performance of general endoscopists.

Most studies focused on the gas and liquid phase of diluted solutions of pyruvic acid to understand the impact of sun light on the degradation of this molecule in the atmosphere. By analyzing concentrated supercooled solutions at 77 K, we demonstrate that instead of decarboxylating, the pyruvic acid molecule plays the role of electron donor and transfers an electron to an acceptor molecule that subsequently degrades to form CO2. We show that this electron transfer occurs via hydrogen bonding and that in aqueous solutions of pyruvic acid, the hydrated form is the electron acceptor. These findings demonstrate that photo-induced electron transfer via hydrogen bonding can occur between two simple carboxylic acids and that this mechanism governs the photochemistry of pyruvic acid, providing unexplored alternative pathways for the decarboxylation of photo-inactive molecules.","query":"cancer"},"36320893":{"ArticleTitle":"QSAR models reveal new EPAC-selective allosteric modulators.","AbstractText":"Exchange proteins directly activated by cAMP (EPAC) are guanine nucleotide exchange factors for the small GTPases, Rap1 and Rap2.

The novel amphiphilic block copolymer of methoxy poly(ethylene glycol) and poly(jasmine lactone) i.e., mPEG-b-PJL, derived from renewable jasmine lactone provides free allyl groups on the backbone thus, allowing flexible and facile post-synthesis functionalization. In this study, mPEG-b-PJL and its carboxyl functionalized polymer mPEG-b-PJL-COOH were utilised to explore the effect of ionic interactions on the drug-polymer behaviour. Various drugs with different pK a values were employed to prepare drug-loaded polymeric micelles (PMs) of mPEG-b-PJL, mPEG-b-PJL-COOH and Soluplus&#174; (polyvinyl caprolactam-polyvinyl acetate-polyethylene glycol graft copolymer) via a nanoprecipitation method. Electrostatic interactions between the COOH pendant on mPEG-b-PJL-COOH and the basic drugs were shown to influence the entrapment efficiency. Additionally, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were employed to understand the polymer-drug interactions at the molecular level and how polymer functionalization influenced these interactions. The release kinetics of the anti-cancer drug sunitinib from mPEG-b-PJL and mPEG-b-PJL-COOH was assessed, and it demonstrated a sustainable drug release pattern, which depended on both pH and temperature. Furthermore, the cytotoxicity of sunitinib-loaded micelles on cancer cells was evaluated. The drug-loaded micelles exhibited dose-dependent toxicity.

However, evidence on feasibility of ePRO in routine cancer care and barriers met in a real-life setting remains limited. We conducted a feasibility study among patients diagnosed with multiple myeloma currently under antineoplastic treatment. Patients filled out weekly ePRO questionnaires and were followed up for 6 months. In case of adverse events, an alert was sent to the clinic. We assessed uptake and adherence, as well as subjective perceptions of patients and clinic staff. A semi-structured literature review was conducted to contextualize results. Eleven patients were recruited and followed up for 6 months. Overall adherence was found at a high level and remained stable throughout the study period. Feedback from patients was positive; however, clinic staff expressed disappointment and frustration, criticising an increase of workload while not perceiving any benefit to the oncological treatment. Both findings were backed by evidence we found in literature. Implementation of ePRO monitoring to routine cancer treatment seems to be feasible regarding patients' acceptance and compliance.

Preliminary attempts to extract ctDNA from BioCaRGOS containing samples demonstrated interference in the extraction of primary samples and the interference with ddPCR analysis when BioCaRGOS was directly introduced to stabilize sample extracts. In our modified technique, we have minimized the interference caused by methanol with ddPCR by complete removal of methanol from the activated BioCaRGOS formulation prior to addition to the biospecimen or ctDNA extract. Interference of the silica matrix present in BioCaRGOS with ctDNA extraction was eliminated through the introduction of invert filtration of the sample prior to extraction.

A total of 1103 out of 2,511 (43.9%) respondents who participated in the survey were physically exercising during the COVID-19 pandemic. 41.8% were exercising at an irregular frequency, while 21.5% were exercising daily, 16.8% were exercising three to five times a week, and 19.9% were exercising once or twice a week. Moreover, 282 (25.6%) respondents started doing some form of exercise during the pandemic. Those significantly were less than 18-year-old, male gender, were single, were non-smokers, and had a diploma or bachelor's degree in a health-related major. These changes in the level of exercise have been attributed by 57.8% of respondents to the health aspects where they realized the importance of exercising in strengthening the immune system against diseases, including COVID-19. The current study showed that lockdown, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, had a positive impact on the healthy lifestyle of the Jordanian population which was attributed to their feeling of the importance of sports practice on the immune system and the availability of time for those activities. However, the younger and individuals were more aware of the importance of these practices which highlights the importance of considering other age groups in future studies of healthy behaviors.","query":"cancer"},"36320651":{"ArticleTitle":"Identifying unmet information needs of advanced cancer patients in Iran: An in-depth qualitative study.","AbstractText":"One of the main vital needs for self-care in patients with advanced cancer is information need. Meeting this need has significant positive effects on improving their treatment and care. This study was conducted to identify the unmet information needs of patients with advanced cancer in Iran. This exploratory study was performed from July to February 2021 in the Kerman University of Medical Sciences cancer treatment centers. Oncologists selected eligible patients by purposeful sampling method. Semistructured and in-depth interviews were conducted with selected patients to collect data. Interviews continued until data saturation. Each interview was audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. In the interviews, 15 patients with advanced cancer ranging in age from 43 to 65 years participated. The most common type of cancer in women was breast (71.4%) and prostate (50%) in men. The two main categories of \"types of unmet information needs\" and \"reasons for not meeting information needs\" were extracted from the analysis of patient interviews, with six and four subcategories, respectively. Cancer patients had a large number of unmet information needs. At the time of identifying the unmet information needs of cancer patients, the basic reasons for not meeting these needs should also be considered because cultural differences and social gaps in societies are inevitable.","query":"cancer"},"36320648":{"ArticleTitle":"Satisfaction with care provided by home-based palliative care service to the cancer patients in Dhaka City of Bangladesh: A cross-sectional study.","AbstractText":"Patient satisfaction is an important quality indicator of health care service. The concept of home-based palliative care has been recently introduced in Bangladesh, but the patients' satisfaction with this care remained unexplored. This study aimed to assess the satisfaction of the cancer patients receiving this care. This cross-sectional study was conducted among 51 surviving cancer patients above 18 years of age registered under the home-based care service of the Department of Palliative Medicine, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University, Dhaka, Bangladesh. Data were collected by face-to-face interviews using a structured questionnaire based on the FAMCARE P16 questionnaire from February to March 2019. Descriptive analysis was done for the sociodemographic and satisfaction-related indicators. A correlation matrix was done to see the correlation among the satisfaction indicators. The majority of the patients (88.2%) were satisfied with the service provided by the home care team. Most (76.5%) of the patients were women, and the mean age was 56.25&#8201;&#177;&#8201;14.8 years. The median duration of getting home-based care was 4 months. Main satisfaction indicators were-assessment of physical symptoms (70.6%), providing information about pain management (70.6%), the inclusion of the family in decision making (76.5%), coordination of care between the members of the home care team (84.3%) and availability of doctors, nurses and palliative care assistants (74.5%). A high correlation was observed between satisfaction regarding the care of physical symptoms and provision of information (R&#8201;=&#8201;0.814, p&#8201;<&#8201;0.001). Also, satisfaction regarding the provision of information and support provided to the family is highly correlated (R&#8201;=&#8201;0.722, p&#8201;<&#8201;0.001). Despite the limitations, the overall satisfaction level of the patients regarding home-based palliative care services in Bangladesh is very high. Home-based palliative can be a solution to provide palliative care to patients who are unable to access institution-based care and improve their quality of life.","query":"cancer"},"36320634":{"ArticleTitle":"In-Depth Metaproteomics Analysis of Oral Microbiome for Lung Cancer.","AbstractText":"The human oral microbiome correlates with numerous diseases, including lung cancer.

Here, we developed a free-flow isoelectric focusing electrophoresis-mass spectrometry- (FFIEF-MS-) based metaproteomics strategy to reduce host interferences and enrich low-abundant bacteria for in-depth interpretation of the oral microbiome. With our method, the number of interfering peptides decreased by 52.87%, whereas the bacterial peptides and species increased by 94.97% and 44.90%, respectively, compared to the conventional metaproteomics approach. We identified 3647 bacterial proteins, which is the most comprehensive oral metaproteomics study to date. Lung cancer-associated bacteria were validated among an independent cohort. The imbalanced Fusobacterium nucleatum and Prevotella histicola and their dysregulated functions in inhibiting immune response and maintaining cell redox homeostasis were revealed.

Despite typically low toxicity in vertebrates, IMI exposure is associated with liver and gastrointestinal toxicity. The mechanism underlying IMI toxicity in mammals is unclear. Pesticide exposure frequently activates xenobiotic nuclear receptors, such as the constitutive androstane receptor (CAR), to induce detoxification phase I and phase II genes. This study examined the role of CAR in mediating IMI off-target toxicity. Female Car-\/- and wild-type (WT) mice were orally administered imidacloprid (50 mg\/kg, twice daily) for 21 days, following which serum, liver, and intestinal tissues were collected. Liver tissue analysis indicated mild inflammation and induction of detoxification gene Cyp2b10 in IMI-exposed WT mice. The absence of CAR increased hepatic IMI accumulation. Microbiome analysis of ileal samples revealed IMI altered microbial diversity in a genotype-specific manner, with increased &#945;-diversity in Car-\/- mice while decreased &#945;-diversity in WT mice. We observed Car-\/- mice exhibit intestinal alterations with decreased CYP-P450 expression, blunted villi height, and increased small intestine length and weight independent of IMI exposure. Our results suggest that IMI is not overtly toxic. However, the absence of xenobiotic nuclear receptor CAR allows increased accumulation of IMI in the liver and disrupts the villi structure and Cyp gene expression in the intestine.","query":"cancer"},"36320614":{"ArticleTitle":"[Quality Assurance of Screening Colonoscopy in Austria and Europe].","AbstractText":"Screening colonoscopy, an efficient tool for reducing the incidence and mortality of colorectal cancer, is only effective if it is performed under high quality standards.

Therefore, we developed a sensitive and efficient biosensor using polyadenine (polyA)-mediated fluorescent spherical nucleic acid (FSNA) for miRNA analysis based on strand displacement reactions on gold nanoparticle (AuNP) surfaces and electrokinetic signal amplification (ESA) on a microfluidic chip. In this FSNA, polyA-DNA biosensor was anchored on AuNP surfaces via intrinsic affinity between adenine and Au. The upright conformational polyA-DNA recognition block hybridized with 6-carboxyfluorescein-labeled reporter-DNA, resulting in fluorescence quenching of FSNA probes induced by AuNP-based resonance energy transfer. Reporter DNA was replaced in the presence of target miRNA, leading to the recovery of reporter-DNA fluorescence. Subsequently, reporter-DNAs were accumulated and detected in the front of with Nafion membrane in the microchannel by ESA. Our method showed high selectivity and sensitivity with a limit of detection of 1.3 pM. This method could also be used to detect miRNA-21 in human serum and urine samples, with recoveries of 104.0%-113.3% and 104.9%-108.0%, respectively. Furthermore, we constructed a chip with three parallel channels for the simultaneous detection of multiple tumor-related miRNAs (miRNA-21, miRNA-141, and miRNA-375), which increased the detection efficiency.

However, to date, metabolic-related studies on QYSLD have not been performed. In this study, a post-targeted screening strategy based on ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight full information tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-QTOF-MSE) was developed to identify QYSLD-related xenobiotics in rat urine. The chemical compound database of QYSLD constituents was established from previous research, and metabolites related to these compounds were predicted in combination with their possible metabolic pathways. The metabolites were identified by extracted ion chromatograms using predicted m\/z values as well as retention time, excimer ions, and fragmentation behavior. Overall, 85 QYSLD-related xenobiotics (20 prototype compounds and 65 metabolites) were characterized from rat urine. The main metabolic reactions and elimination features of QYSLD included oxidation, reduction, decarboxylation, hydrolysis, demethylation, glucuronidation, sulfation, methylation, deglycosylation, acetylation, and associated combination reactions. Of the identified molecules, 14 prototype compounds and 58 metabolites were slowly eliminated, thus accumulating in&#160;vivo over an extended period, while five prototypes and two metabolites were present in&#160;vivo for a short duration.

Here, enzyme-free signal-amplification nanoprobes as an effective tool are developed for three-dimensional (3D) high-resolution profiling of key miRNA molecules in single migrating cells, where distinct migration modes are precisely driven by microconfinement-engineered microchips. The constructed nanoprobes exhibit intuitive and ultrasensitive miRNA characterization in vitro by virtue of a single-molecule imaging microscope, and the differential expression and intracellular locations in different cell lines are successfully monitored. Furthermore, 3D spatial distribution of miR-141 at high resolution in flexible phenotypes of migrating cells is reconstructed in the engineered biomimetic microenvironment. The results indicate that miR-141 may be involved in the metastatic transition from a slow to a fast migration state.

Although the mechanism of COVID-19 is not fully understood, potential clinical targets have been identified for pharmacological, immunological, and vaccinal approaches. Pharmacological approaches including drug repositioning have been a priority for initial COVID-19 therapy due to the time-consuming nature of the vaccine development process. COVID-19 drugs have been shown to manage the antiviral infection cycle (cell entry and replication of proteins and genomic RNA) and anti-inflammation.

We used&#160;a clinically compliant protocol to expand Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and Wilms tumor 1 (WT1) antigen-specific CD8+ T&#160;cells, and leveraged T&#160;cell exhaustion-associated inhibitory receptor blockade to improve T&#160;cell expansion. Several inhibitory receptors were expressed early by ex&#160;vivo-expanded antigen-specific CD8+ T&#160;cells, including PD-1 and TIM3, with co-expression matching evidence of T&#160;cell dysfunction as the cultures progressed. Introduction of anti-PD-L1 and anti-TIM3 blockade in combination (but not individually) to the culture led to markedly improved antigen-specific T&#160;cell expansion without inducing T&#160;cell dysfunction.

In developed countries, breast cancer as a multifactorial disease is a major health concern, and its incidence is constantly rising in low and middle-income countries. Numerous studies have demonstrated that phytochemicals such as carotenoids inhibit breast cancer growth and induce apoptosis. We recently enhanced the solubility of capsanthin in water by encapsulating it in diosgenin polyethylene glycol succinate, a novel non-ionic surfactant. Thus, this study aims to evaluate the cytotoxicity of water-soluble capsanthin-loaded micelles in MDA-MB-231 cells in vitro through tetrazolium dye MTT assay. In the current study, capsanthin, a hydrophobic carotenoid, is extracted from sweet red pepper (Capsicum annuum). Capsanthin-loaded diosgenin polyethylene glycol succinate 1000 (cap-DPGS-1000) micelles were prepared from capsanthin extract (cap) and diosgenin polyethylene glycol succinate 1000 (DPGS-1000) using the solid dispersion method. The capsanthin extract and cap-DPGS-1000 micelles were characterized by UV-visible spectroscopy, high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), particle size distribution, polydispersity, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The effects of capsanthin extract and cap-DPGS-1000 micelles on a human triple-negative breast cancer cell line (MDA-MB-231) were tested to check the cell viability, proliferation and cytotoxicity of the micelles. The solubility of encapsulated cap-DPGS-1000 micelles in water is greatly enhanced and leads to an increased scope for localized drug delivery, a better delivery option for treating residual cancerous tumours. The encapsulated capsanthin showed a sustained release in simulated intestinal fluid (pH=6.8). Our research proposes a sustained drug delivery system that ensures effective and controlled release to the affected site. The characterization data revealed no change in the structure and functional groups in the encapsulated capsanthin. The IC50 value of the cap-DPGS-1000 micelles against MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells was (3.10&#177;1.09) &#956;g\/mL, which is much lower than of capsanthin extract ((81.1&#177;1.5) &#956;g\/mL). Capsanthin extract and capsanthin-loaded micelles are promising drug candidates to induce apoptosis and increase reactive oxygen species (ROS) in cancer cells. The result shows the cytotoxic effect of capsanthin and capsanthin-loaded micelles on MDA-MB-231 cell line for the first time. Capsanthin from sweet red pepper (Capsicum annuum) showed remarkable cytotoxic effect on the triple-negative MDA-MB-231 cell line.","query":"cancer"},"36320328":{"ArticleTitle":"An organometallic analogue of combretastatin A-4 and its apoptosis-inducing effects on lymphoma, leukemia and other tumor cells in vitro.","AbstractText":"Hexacarbonyl[1,3-dimethoxy-5-((4'-methoxyphenyl)ethynyl)benzene]dicobalt (NAHO27), an organometallic analogue of combretastatin A-4, has been synthesized and its activity against lymphoma, leukemia, breast cancer and melanoma cells has been investigated. It was shown that NAHO27 specifically induces apoptosis in BJAB lymphoma and Nalm-6 leukemia cells at low micromolar concentration and does not affect normal leukocytes in vitro. It also proved to be active against vincristine and daunorubicin resistant leukemia cell lines with p-glycoprotein-caused multidrug resistance and showed a pronounced (550%) synergistic effect when co-applied with vincristine at very low concentrations. Mechanistic investigations revealed NAHO27 to induce apoptosis via the mitochondrial (intrinsic) pathway as reflected by the processing of caspases 3 and 9, the involvement of Bcl-2 and smac\/DIABLO, and the reduction of mitochondrial membrane potential.

Motivated by our previous findings on miR-143\/145 value in disease prognosis, we have studied the underlying epigenetic regulation of the miR-143\/145 cluster in BlCa. Expression and DNA methylation of miR-143\/145 cluster were analyzed in our screening (n&#160;= 162) and The Cancer Genome Atlas Urothelial Bladder Carcinoma (TCGA-BLCA; n&#160;= 412) cohorts. Survival analysis was performed using tumor relapse and progression as clinical endpoints for non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC; TaT1), while disease progression and patients' death were used for muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC; T2-T4). TCGA-BLCA served as validation cohort. Bootstrap analysis was carried out for internal validation, while decision curve analysis was used to evaluate clinical benefit. TCGA-BLCA and screening cohorts highlighted MIR145 core promoter as the pivotal, epigenetic regulatory region on cluster's expression. Lower methylation of MIR145 core promoter was associated with aggressive disease phenotype, higher risk for NMIBC short-term progression, and poor MIBC survival. MIR145 methylation-fitted multivariate models with established disease markers clearly enhanced patients' risk stratification and prediction of treatment outcome. MIR145 core promoter methylation was identified as a potent epigenetic regulator of miR-143\/145 cluster, supporting modern personalized risk stratification and management in BlCa.","query":"cancer"},"36320322":{"ArticleTitle":"Cytidine-containing tails robustly enhance and prolong protein production of synthetic mRNA in cell and in&#160;vivo.","AbstractText":"Synthetic mRNAs are rising rapidly as alternative therapeutic agents for delivery of proteins. However, the practical use of synthetic mRNAs has been restricted by their low cellular stability as well as poor protein production efficiency. The key roles of poly(A) tail on mRNA biology inspire us to explore the optimization of tail sequence to overcome the aforementioned limitations. Here, the systematic substitution of non-A nucleotides in the tails revealed that cytidine-containing tails can substantially enhance the protein production rate and duration of synthetic mRNAs both in&#160;vitro and in&#160;vivo. Such C-containing tails shield synthetic mRNAs from deadenylase CCR4-NOT transcription complex, as the catalytic CNOT proteins, especially CNOT6L and CNOT7, have lower efficiency in trimming of cytidine. Consistently, these enhancement effects of C-containing tails were observed on all synthetic mRNAs tested and were independent of transfection reagents and cell types. As the C-containing tails can be used along with other mRNA enhancement technologies to synergically boost protein production, we believe that these tails can be broadly used on synthetic mRNAs to directly promote their clinical applications.","query":"cancer"},"36320313":{"ArticleTitle":"Suppression of the malignancy of mammary tumor in mice model by inactivated preparation of Mycobacterium obuense.","AbstractText":"Breast cancer (BC) is a significant cause of global mortality in women.

Forty-two mice were equally divided into control as well as low dose (0.20 mg 100 &#181;L-1) and high dose (0.50 mg 100 &#181;L-1) groups of M. obuense to investigate gene expression in the antitumor effects of M. obuense. In one group, paclitaxel was administrated as a choice drug in BC treatment. Antitumor manners were characterized by cytotoxicity against tumor target cells, size of the tumor and the expression of some BC metastatic genes together with pathology. The MTT assay demonstrated that different concentrations of both low and a high dose of bacteria did present no cytotoxicity effect on 4T1 cells. According to our findings, M. obuense significantly repressed tumor growth. M. obuense downregulated the expression of collagen type I alpha 1 (COLIA1), cFos, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), claudin 3 (cldn3), and conversely, activated transcription factor 4 (ATF4) and Twist related protein-1 (Twist1). All these alternations induced a decrease in the migratory and invasive capabilities of BC. The result of pathology was indicative of tumor regression in the paclitaxel and HK- M. obuense -recipient group. Thus, it seems most likely that M. obuense might impinge upon cell growth and metastatic behavior of malignant cells exerting anti-tumor activity in BC.","query":"cancer"},"36320308":{"ArticleTitle":"Mutation and up-regulation of TP53 in ovine pulmonary adenocarcinoma lung cells as a model of human lung cancer.","AbstractText":"Ovine pulmonary adenocarcinoma (OPA) is a model of human lung cancer&#8206; and fatal viral disease that causes neoplasia in sheep respiratory cells. &#8206;In the current study, 986 lung samples was inspected in the slaughterhouse, and finally twenty OPA &#8206; lung organs were clinically diagnosed and five healthy lung organs were assigned as the control sample.

Enhanced cell membrane translocation of antibodies can be achieved by the covalent attachment of cell-penetrating peptides, including the HIV-1-derived transactivator of transcription (TAT) peptide. This study evaluated the cellular internalisation properties of five anti-HER2 Herceptin-TAT conjugates with degrees of TAT labelling (DOLTAT) ranging from one to five. Herceptin-TAT conjugates were synthesised via a strain-promoted alkyne-azide cycloaddition reaction, characterised by UV-vis spectroscopy, MALDI-TOF, and gel electrophoresis, then radiolabelled with zirconium-89 to permit measurement of cellular internalisation by gamma counting. [89Zr]Zr-DFO-Her-TAT(0-5) conjugates were isolated in high radiochemical purity (>99%) and exhibited high stability in murine and human serum over 7 days at 37 &#176;C. Significant increases in cellular internalisation were observed for [89Zr]Zr-DFO-Her-TAT conjugates with DOLTAT values of 2 and above in SKBR3 (high HER2) cells over 48 h, in contrast to low-level non-specific uptake in MDA-MB-468 (low HER2) cells that did not increase over time. Notably, [89Zr]Zr-DFO-Her-TAT conjugates with DOLTAT of 3, 4, and 5 reached uptake values in SKBR3 cells of 5, 6, and 8% of the applied dose at 48 h respectively, representing 9, 10, 14-fold increases relative to the TAT-free control conjugate, [89Zr]Zr-DFO-Her-TAT(0).","query":"cancer"},"36320274":{"ArticleTitle":"One-pot synthesis and enzyme-responsiveness of amphiphilic doxorubicin prodrug nanomicelles for cancer therapeutics.","AbstractText":"In this study, we report a one-pot synthesis and enzyme-responsiveness of polyethylene glycol (PEG) and glutamic acid (Glu)-based amphiphilic doxorubicin (DOX) prodrug nanomicelles for cancer therapeutics.

The DOX-loaded nanomicelles showed a DLS-measured average size of 107 nm and excellent stability in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 7 days. The drug loading and cumulative release rates were measured by ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectrophotometry at 481 nm. The cumulative release rate could reach 100% in an enzyme-rich environment. Further, the therapeutic efficiency of nanomicelles to cancer cells was determined by cell viability and cellular uptake and distribution using HeLa cells.

Including HBV as a diagnosis, we performed a retrospective study of all hospitalisations in Spain the Spanish National Registry of Hospital Discharges. Information was retrieved from 1997 to 2017. From 73,939,642 nationwide hospital admissions during the study period, 129,634 (0.17%) included HBV as diagnosis. Their number doubled from 2007 to 2017 and the median age increased from 44 to 58&#8201;years. Most HBV admissions recorded chronic hepatitis B. In-hospital death occurred in 6.4%. Co-infection with HIV or hepatitis C virus occurred in 11.9% and 23.3%, respectively. Patients with HIV-HBV co-infection had significantly greater mortality than individuals with HBV mono-infection. The rate of HBV hospitalisations significantly increased over time with a transient drop around 2007, coincident with the arrival of new potent oral antivirals. Although the proportion of HBV hepatic decompensation events has declined, the rate of liver cancer continues to rise. The small subset of patients with hepatitis delta superinfection increasingly and disproportionately accounts for hepatic decompensation events and liver cancer.

This study investigated the impact of these treatment advances on the expected benefits of LDCT screening. A microsimulation model of LDCT screening for high-risk individuals under standard systemic treatments (chemotherapy and radiation therapy) and novel treatments (immunotherapy and targeted therapy) was used. The model assumed a reduction in advanced-stage disease consistent with the NLST, and given the stage at diagnosis, it projected survival. The disease-specific relative mortality reduction (MR) due to LDCT screening was projected in the trial setting and in a population eligible for LDCT screening under the current US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendations. The availability of novel treatments reduced the MR in the LDCT arm of the NLST from 15% to 13.5% and the number of lung cancer deaths prevented from 310 to 224 per 100,000 persons screened. Over 10&#160;years, population LDCT screening based on USPSTF recommendations prevented 374 lung cancer deaths per 100,000 under standard treatments (13.3% MR) and 236 per 100,000 under fully adopted novel treatments (10.6% MR). The number needed to screen to avert one death over 10 years was 270 under standard treatments and 440 under novel treatments. The transition from standard systemic treatments to novel treatments is expected to reduce the relative and absolute mortality benefits of LDCT screening.

GOLPH3 overexpression has been reported in several human solid cancers, including glioblastoma, breast cancer, colorectal cancer, nonsmall cell lung cancer, epithelial ovarian cancer, prostate cancer, gastric cancer, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Although the molecular mechanisms that link GOLPH3 to tumorigenesis require further investigation, it is likely that GOLPH3 may act by controlling the intracellular movement of key oncogenic molecules, between the Golgi compartments and\/or between the Golgi and the endoplasmic reticulum. Indeed, numerous evidence indicates that deregulation of intracellular vesicle trafficking contributes to several aspects of cancer phenotypes. However, a direct and clear link between extracellular vesicle movements and GOLPH3 is still missing. In the past years several lines of evidence have implicated GOLPH3 in the regulation of extracellular vesicle content. Specifically, a new role for GOLPH3 has emerged in controlling the internalization of exosomes containing either oncogenic proteins or noncoding RNAs, especially micro-RNA. Although far from being elucidated, growing evidence indicates that GOLPH3 does not increase quantitatively the excretion of exosomes, but rather regulates the exosome content. In particular, recent data support a role for GOLPH3 for loading specific oncogenic molecules into the exosomes, driving both tumor malignancy and metastasis formation. Additionally, the older literature indirectly implicates GOLPH3 in cancerogenesis through its function in controlling hepatitis C virus secretion, which in turn is linked to hepatocellular carcinoma formation. Thus, GOLPH3 might promote tumorigenesis in unexpected ways, involving both direct and indirect routes. If these data are further confirmed, the spectrum of action of GOLPH3 in tumor formation will significantly expand, indicating this protein as a strong candidate for targeted cancer therapy.","query":"cancer"},"36320173":{"ArticleTitle":"Use, response and outcomes of second-line chemotherapy in patients with advanced biliary tract cancers.","AbstractText":"First-line chemotherapy for advanced biliary tract cancers has been established as gemcitabine and cisplatin; however, there is currently no recognized standard second-line chemotherapy.

Sensitivity of biomarkers for diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis was 70.6% (cut off value&#8201;>&#8201;190 pg\/mL for sTREM-1, 71% (cut off value&#8201;>&#8201;260 pg\/mL) for PCT, 85.3% (cut off value&#8201;>&#8201;193 U\/L) for LDH, 94.1% (cut off value&#8201;>&#8201;8&#160;mg\/l) for CRP, 64.7% (cut off value&#8201;<&#8201;5200 cells\/ml) for WBC, and 85.3% (cut off value&#8201;>&#8201;23&#160;mm\/h) for ESR. Twelve patients died, with significantly increased sTREM-1 levels and decreased WBC count in them. According to our data, evaluation of the biomarkers can help in the diagnosis, management, and prediction of the severity of Aspergillus infection, and the rational use of antifungal agents in immunocompromised patients.","query":"cancer"},"36320072":{"ArticleTitle":"B7-H3 targeted CAR-T cells show highly efficient anti-tumor function against osteosarcoma both in vitro and in vivo.","AbstractText":"Osteosarcoma (OS) mainly happens in children and youths. Surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy are the common therapies for osteosarcoma treatment but all their anti-tumor effects are limited. In recent years, a new cellular therapy, CAR-T, a cellular immunotherapy with genetically engineered T cells bearing chimeric antigen receptor targeting specific tumor-associated antigen, has been proved to be an effective therapy against acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Thus, CAR-T is a potentially effective therapy for osteosarcoma treatment. A CAR gene targeting B7-H3 antigen was constructed into lentiviral vector through molecular biology techniques. Then, the CAR gene was transferred to T cells through lentiviral delivery system, and the CAR-T cells were largely expanded using in vitro culture technology. The in vitro anti-tumor effect of CAR-T cells was evaluated through Real Time Cell Analysis system (RTCA) and ELISA assay. The in vivo anti-tumor capabilities of CAR-T cells were evaluated using the patient-derived xenografts (PDX) model of osteosarcoma. The third-generation CAR-T cells we constructed could target the B7-H3 antigen, and the phenotype of CAR-T cells was consistent with normal T cells; The CAR-T cells showed superior antitumor effects both in vitro and in vivo. Our study showed that B7-H3 targeted CAR-T cells had high anti-tumor efficacy against osteosarcoma both in vitro and in vivo, which proved that B7-H3 targeted CAR-T therapy is potentially effective for osteosarcoma treatment.","query":"cancer"},"36320066":{"ArticleTitle":"Population-based estimate for the correlation of the Oncotype Dx Breast Recurrence Score&#174; result and Ki-67 IHC MIB-1 pharmDx in HR+, HER2-, node-positive early breast cancer.","AbstractText":"The United States Food and Drug Administration recently approved a Ki-67 immunohistochemistry (IHC) assay to identify patients with early breast cancer at high disease recurrence risk.

This study assessed the correlation between Recurrence Score&#174; (RS) results and the Ki-67 IHC MIB-1 pharmDx assay. HR+, HER2-, N1 IBC samples with RS results were examined by Ki-67 IHC; 311 specimens were collected, including 275 without regard to RS (\"unselected RS\") and 36 more with RS 26-100; 12 were lymph node negative upon pathology report review, and one had no Ki-67 score, leaving 262 unselected RS and 298 total samples.

The purpose of the current study was to determine changes in DNA methylation status and mRNA expression of thyroid hormone receptor beta (THRB), as a tumor suppressor, and thyroid hormone inactivating enzyme, type 3 deiodinase (DIO3) genes, in human epithelial colon tissues of healthy obese individuals. Colon biopsies were analyzed by methylation sensitive-high resolution melting (MS-HRM) to investigate promoter methylation of DIO3 and THRB, and by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction to assay expression of DIO3 and THRB mRNA on eighteen obese and twenty-one normal-weight healthy men. There was no significant difference in mean methylation levels at the THRB promoter region between the two groups. Nevertheless, obesity decreased THRB expression levels, significantly (P&#8201;<&#8201;0.05; fold change: 0.19). Furthermore, obesity attenuated DNA methylation (P&#8201;<&#8201;0.001) and enhanced mRNA expression of DIO3 (P&#8201;<&#8201;0.05; fold change: 3).

Their biogenesis involves four key steps, including cargo sorting, MVB formation and maturation, transport of MVBs, and MVB fusion with the plasma membrane. Each process is modulated through the competition or coordination of multiple mechanisms, whereby diverse repertoires of molecular cargos are sorted into distinct subpopulations of exosomes, resulting in the high heterogeneity of exosomes. Intriguingly, cancer cells exploit various strategies, such as aberrant gene expression, posttranslational modifications, and altered signaling pathways, to regulate the biogenesis, composition, and eventually functions of exosomes to promote cancer progression. Therefore, exosome biogenesis-targeted therapy is being actively explored. In this review, we systematically summarize recent progress in understanding the machinery of exosome biogenesis and how it is regulated in the context of cancer. In particular, we highlight pharmacological targeting of exosome biogenesis as a promising cancer therapeutic strategy.","query":"cancer"},"36320042":{"ArticleTitle":"Design and synthesis of novel ureido and thioureido conjugated hydrazone derivatives with potent anticancer activity.","AbstractText":"Compounds possessing urea\/thiourea moiety have a wide range of biological properties including anticancer activity.

As cancer cells proliferate, demand for oxygen can outstrip supply reducing tumour oxygenation. In solid tumours this is contributed to by disorganized blood vessel development. Tumour hypoxia is associated with resistance to treatment, more aggressive disease behaviour and an increased likelihood of metastatic progression. It can be measured using both invasive and non-invasive methods to varying degrees of accuracy. The presence of hypoxia stimulates a complex cellular network of downstream factors including Hypoxia Inducible Factor 1 (HIF1), C-X-C motif chemokine 4 (CXCR4) and Hypoxia-inducible glycolytic enzyme hexokinase-2 (HK2) amongst many others. They work by affecting different mechanisms including influencing angiogenesis, treatment resistance, immune surveillance and the ability to metastasize all of which contribute to a more aggressive disease pattern. Tumour hypoxia has been correlated with poorer outcomes and worse prognosis in patients. The correlation between hypoxic microenvironments and poor prognosis has led to an interest in trying to therapeutically target this phenomenon. Various methods have been used to target hypoxic microenvironments. Hypoxia-activated prodrugs (HAPs) are drugs that are only activated within hypoxic environments and these agents have been subject to investigation in several clinical trials. Drugs that target downstream factors of hypoxic environments including HIF inhibitors, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors and vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) therapies are also in development and being used in combination in clinical trials. Despite promising pre-clinical data, clinical trials of hypoxia targeting strategies have proven challenging. Further understanding of the effect of hypoxia and related molecular mechanisms in human rather than animal models is required to guide novel therapeutic strategies and future trial design. This review will discuss the currently available methods of hypoxia targeting and assessments that may be considered in planning future clinical trials. It will also outline key trials to date in both the solid and haemato-oncology treatment spheres and discuss the limitations that may have impacted on clinical success to date.","query":"cancer"},"36320039":{"ArticleTitle":"Mendelian randomization analysis of factors related to ovulation and reproductive function and endometrial cancer risk.","AbstractText":"Observational epidemiological studies suggest a link between several factors related to ovulation and reproductive function and endometrial cancer (EC) risk; however, it is not clear whether these relationships are causal, and whether the risk factors act independently of each other.

Additionally, multivariate analysis was performed to elucidate the relationship between the number of live births, age at last live birth, and years ovulating and other related factors such as age at natural menopause, age at menarche, and body mass index (BMI). Secondly, we used Mendelian randomization (MR) to assess if these observed relationships were causal. Genome-wide significant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were extracted from previous studies of woman's number of live births, age at menopause and menarche, and BMI. We conducted a genome-wide association analysis using the UKBB to identify SNPs associated with years ovulating, years using the contraceptive pill, and age at last live birth. We found evidence for a causal effect of the number of live births (inverse variance weighted (IVW) odds ratio (OR): 0.537, p&#8201;=&#8201;0.006), the number of years ovulating (IVW OR: 1.051, p&#8201;=&#8201;0.014), in addition to the known risk factors BMI, age at menarche, and age at menopause on EC risk in the univariate MR analyses.

This study aims to examine the difference in mortality risk for key cancers among women and explore the effect of the economic crisis in the mid-1990s separately for occupational and industrial categories. Data from 1980 to 2015 were gathered from the Japanese Population Census and National Vital Statistics conducted in the same year. A Poisson regression analysis was used to estimate mortality risk and mortality trends for lung, gastric, pancreatic and colorectal cancer among Japanese working women aged 25-64 years. Across most industrial and occupational groups, the trends in age-standardised cancer mortality rate for women have declined. Workers in management, security and transportation have a higher cancer mortality risk than sales workers. The risk of death from all four cancers is higher for workers in the mining and electricity industries than for wholesale and retail workers. To improve the health and well-being of employed Japanese women, it is crucial to monitor cancer mortality trends.

However, the different expression patterns and prognostic values of all three IQGAP isoforms in HCC have not yet been analyzed simultaneously. We analyzed the transcriptional and survival data of IQGAPs in HCC patients using Oncomine, UALCAN, Kaplan-Meier Plotter, cBioPortal, and GeneMANIA. We further examined tumor and adjacent normal tissues from 250 HCC patients using immunohistochemistry to assess the relationship between IQGAPs expression and clinicopathological features and validate the prognostic value of IQGAPs. In addition, we analyzed transcriptional changes of IQGAPs with regards to survival data in HCC patients from the TCGA-LIHC (liver hepatocellular carcinoma) cohort to validate our results. We found that the expression levels of IQGAP1 and 3 were significantly elevated in HCC tissues than in normal liver tissues, whereas the expression level of IQGAP2 was decreased in the former than in the latter. The clinical data showed that positive IQGAP1 expression was associated with larger tumor size, advanced tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) stage, poor relapse-free survival (RFS), and overall survival (OS), and positive IQGAP3 expression was associated with poorer tumor differentiation, RFS, and OS.

This study aimed to compare the bone-healing effects of the resveratrol monomer to the resveratrol dimer (gnetin C found in melinjo seed extract) in a model of EP and investigate the involvement of Nrf2 for effects of either form of resveratrol. EP was induced experimentally in mice by placement of a 9&#8201;-&#8201;0 silk ligature around the left second molar. Mice received 10&#160;mg\/kg of either resveratrol monomer or dimer intraperitoneally on day 15 after induction of EP. The bone level around the ligated teeth was measured over time, and levels of proinflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress were measured in the periodontal tissues around the ligated teeth. Resveratrol dimer induced greater periodontal bone healing as compared to that related to use of the resveratrol monomer. It appears that healing of periodontal bone in either group was likely related to master regulation of antioxidant nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) significantly. Downregulation of IL-1&#946;, a proinflammatory cytokine was also demonstrated in the resveratrol dimer group.

As a hallmark of cancer, Warburg effect promotes cancer metastasis and remodels the tumor microenvironment, including promoting angiogenesis, immune suppression, cancer-associated fibroblasts formation and drug resistance. Targeting Warburg metabolism would be a promising method for the treatment of CRC. In this review, we summarize information about the roles of Warburg effect in tumor microenvironment to elucidate the mechanisms governing Warburg effect in CRC and to identify novel targets for therapy.","query":"cancer"},"36319987":{"ArticleTitle":"Paradoxes of breast cancer incidence and mortality in two corners of Europe.","AbstractText":"Breast cancer incidence is rising globally, while mortality rates show a geographical heterogenous pattern. Early detection and treatment have been proven to have a profound impact on breast cancer prognosis. The aim of his study was to compare breast cancer incidence, mortality, and survival rates in two contrasting corners of Europe, Sweden and Crete, to better understand cancer determinants with focus on disease burden and sociocultural factors. Breast cancer data from Sweden and Crete was derived from registries. Incidence and mortality were expressed as Age-Standardized Incidence Rates (ASIR), Age-Standardized Mortality Rates (ASMR). Breast cancer incidence has for decades risen in Sweden and on Crete. In 2019, ASIR was 217.5 in Sweden and 58.9 on Crete, (p&#160;<&#8201;0.001). Mortality rates showed opposite trends. ASMR in Sweden was reduced from 25.5 to 16.8 (2005-2019) while on Crete, ASMR increased from 22.1 to 25.3. A successive rise in survival rate in Sweden with a 5-year survival rate of 92% since 2015, but a converse development on Crete with 85% 5-year survival rate the same year. The incidence of breast cancer is slowly rising in both studied regions, but mortality increases on Crete in contrast to Sweden with sinking mortality rates. The interpretation of these findings is that differences in health care systems and health policies including differences in early detection like screening programs and early treatment, as well as sociocultural factors in the two countries might play an important role on the differences found in breast cancer burden.","query":"cancer"},"36319985":{"ArticleTitle":"Prognostic value of combined MTV and ADC derived from baseline FDG PET\/MRI in aggressive non-Hodgkins lymphoma.","AbstractText":"The aim of this prospective study was to investigate the prognostic value of metabolic tumor volume (MTV) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) from baseline FDG PET\/MRI compared to established clinical risk factors in terms of progression free survival (PFS) at 2&#8201;years in a cohort of diffuse large B-cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) and high-grade-B-cell lymphoma (HGBCL). Thirty-three patients and their baseline PET\/MRI examinations were included. Images were read by two pairs of nuclear medicine physicians and radiologists for defining lymphoma lesions. MTV was computed on PET, and up to six lymphoma target lesions with restricted diffusion was defined for each PET\/MRI examination. Minimum ADC (ADCmin) and the corresponding mean ADC (ADCmean) from the target lesion with the lowest ADCmin were included in the analyses. For the combined PET\/MRI parameters, the ratio between MTV and the target lesion with the lowest ADCmin (MTV\/ADCmin) and the corresponding ADCmean (MTV\/ADCmean) was calculated for each patient. Clinical, histological, and PET\/MRI parameters were compared between the treatment failure and treatment response group, while survival analyses for each variable was performed by using univariate Cox regression. In case of significant variables in the Cox regression analyses, Kaplan-Meier survival analyses with log-rank test was used to study the effect of the variables on PFS. ECOC PS scale &#8805;2 (p&#8201;=&#8201;0.05) and ADCmean (p&#8201;=&#8201;0.05) were significantly different between the treatment failure group (n&#8201;=&#8201;6) and those with treatment response (n&#8201;=&#8201;27). Survival analyses showed that ADCmean was associated with PFS (p&#8201;=&#8201;0.02, [HR 2.3 for 1 SD increase]), while combining MTV and ADC did not predict outcome. In addition, ECOG PS &#8805;2 (p&#8201;=&#8201;0.01, [HR 13.3]) and histology of HGBCL (p&#8201;=&#8201;0.02 [HR 7.6]) was significantly associated with PFS. ADCmean derived from baseline MRI could be a prognostic imaging biomarker for DLBCL and HGBCL. Baseline staging with PET\/MRI could therefore give supplementary prognostic information compared to today's standard PET\/CT.","query":"cancer"},"36319978":{"ArticleTitle":"Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 2 immunohistochemical expression in medullary thyroid carcinoma: implications in prognosis and immunomodulatory effects.","AbstractText":"The linkage between IDO2 expression and cancer progression is still unclear, particularly in medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC). Our purpose is to unveil the potential correlations between IDO2 status, clinical-pathological parameters, patients' prognosis, and the possible immunomodulatory functions in MTC. Immunohistochemical expression levels of IDO2 were evaluated in the resected MTC surgical specimens and corresponding lymph nodes. CD4&#8201;+&#8201;T cell infiltration was also evaluated by immunohistochemical analysis in the MTC tissues. The association of the IDO2 expression level with clinicopathologic characteristics, overall survival (OS)\/recurrence-free survival (RFS), and CD4&#8201;+&#8201;T cell infiltration were retrospectively investigated. High expression of IDO2 is closely associated with more aggressive clinicopathological features, such as multifocality, ETE, a higher pT stage and especially a higher pN stage. Moreover, a significant difference in RFS was observed between the IDO2-high and IDO2-low groups. IDO2 expression of lymph node tissues was significantly related to the metastasis status. Furthermore, we found that IDO2 expression is negatively correlated with CD4&#8201;+&#8201;T cell infiltrations in MTC tissues. The expression level of IDO2 is associated with aggressive characteristics and is predictive of poor prognosis in patients with MTC. Also, an interesting observation is that IDO2 involvement in MTC showed a moderate sexual dimorphism, of which female patients tend to be more affected by IDO2 status. Moreover, our results showed the potential immunomodulatory functions of IDO2. The close relationship between IDO2 and CD4&#8201;+&#8201;T cell infiltration in the MTC microenvironment, together with its potential prognostic implications, makes it possible for IDO2 to serve as an alternative drug target in cancer immunotherapy and as a new prognostic tool.","query":"cancer"},"36319976":{"ArticleTitle":"Identification and validation of a novel signature as a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker in colorectal cancer.","AbstractText":"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common malignant neoplasms worldwide. Although marker genes associated with CRC have been identified previously, only a few have fulfilled the therapeutic demand. Therefore, based on differentially expressed genes (DEGs), this study aimed to establish a promising and valuable signature model to diagnose CRC and predict patient's prognosis. The key genes were screened from DEGs to establish a multiscale embedded gene co-expression network, protein-protein interaction network, and survival analysis. A support vector machine (SVM) diagnostic model was constructed by a supervised classification algorithm. Univariate Cox analysis was performed to construct two prognostic signatures for overall survival and disease-free survival by Kaplan-Meier analysis, respectively. Independent clinical prognostic indicators were identified, followed by univariable and multivariable Cox analysis. GSEA was used to evaluate the gene enrichment analysis and CIBERSORT was used to estimate the immune cell infiltration. Finally, key genes were validated by qPCR and IHC. In this study, four key genes (DKC1, FLNA, CSE1L and NSUN5) were screened. The SVM diagnostic model, consisting of 4-gene signature, showed a good performance for the diagnostic (AUC&#8201;=&#8201;0.9956). Meanwhile, the four-gene signature was also used to construct a risk score prognostic model for disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS), and the results indicated that the prognostic model performed best in predicting the DFS and OS of CRC patients. The risk score was validated as an independent prognostic factor to exhibit the accurate survival prediction for OS according to the independent prognostic value. Furthermore, immune cell infiltration analysis demonstrated that the high-risk group had a higher proportion of macrophages M0, and T cells CD4 memory resting was significantly higher in the low-risk group than in the high-risk group. In addition, functional analysis indicated that WNT and other four cancer-related signaling pathways were the most significantly enriched pathways in the high-risk group. Finally, qRT-PCR and IHC results demonstrated that the high expression of DKC1, CSE1L and NSUN5, and the low expression of FLNA were risk factors of CRC patients with a poor prognosis. In this study, diagnosis and prognosis models were constructed based on the screened genes of DKC1, FLNA, CSE1L and NSUN5. The four-gene signature exhibited an excellent ability in CRC diagnosis and prognostic prediction. Our study supported and highlighted that the four-gene signature is conducive to better prognostic risk stratification and potential therapeutic targets for CRC patients.","query":"cancer"},"36319973":{"ArticleTitle":"The influence of adjuvant chemotherapy dose intensity on overall survival in resected colon cancer: a multicentered retrospective analysis.","AbstractText":"Colorectal cancer remains the second leading cause of cancer death in North America. Fluorouracil and oxaliplatin based adjuvant chemotherapy for resected colon cancer (CC) reduces cancer recurrence, but also causes significant toxicity requiring dose reductions. The effect of dose intensity on survival outcomes is not fully understood and strengthening the evidence supports informed decision making between patients and oncologists. Patients treated with adjuvant chemotherapy, between 2006 and 2011, for resected colon cancer at four Canadian academic cancer centers were retrospectively analyzed.

Based on the manually curated ferroptosis-related gene set and TCGA-LIHC dataset of Asian patients, we used DESeq2, Kaplan-Meier analysis, and univariate Cox regression to identify differentially expressed ferroptosis-related genes with significantly prognostic capacity. A risk signature was constructed based on the selected genes for predicting the survival of HCC patients in Asia. The survival prediction accuracy was confirmed by the time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Gene set variation analysis (GSVA) was used to explore the functional associations of the signature. Ferroptosis potential index (FPI) and xCell algorithm was applied to quantify ferroptosis and immune cell infiltration, respectively. Two independent datasets from the GEO and the ICGC database were used for external validation. The ferroptosis-related signature could accurately predict the survival outcomes of HCC patients in Asian (p value&#8201;<&#8201;0.0001). We showed that the signature was an independent factor and was beneficial in elevating risk stratification of current clinicopathologic features, such as the amount of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and residual tumor classification. Functional characterization showed that critical processes in tumorigenesis belonged to the high-risk groups, for example inflammatory response, which may be the main driver of HCC. The high-risk group had higher FPIs and infiltrations of macrophages and T-helper cells than the low-risk group. Furthermore, two independent cohorts confirmed the prognostic value of our signature.

A nanoparticulate formulation (HPNP) based on a cathepsin B-degradable glutamate-tyrosine co-polymer that carries hematoporphyrin was used in this study for the SDT-based treatment of PDAC. Cathepsin B levels in BxPC-3 and PANC-1 cells were correlated to cellular uptake of HPNP. The HPNP efficiency to induce a sonodynamic effect at varying ultrasound parameters, and at different oxygenation and pH conditions, was investigated. The biodistribution, tumour accumulation profile, and antitumour efficacy of HPNP in SDT were examined in immunocompetent mice carrying bilateral ectopic murine pancreatic tumours. The immune response profile of excised tumour tissues was also examined. The HPNP formulation significantly improved cellular uptake of hematoporphyrin for both BxPC-3 and PANC-1 cells, while increase of cellular uptake was positively correlated in PANC-1 cells. There was a clear SDT-induced cytotoxicity at the ultrasound conditions tested, and the treatment impaired the capacity of both BxPC-3 and PANC-1 cells to form colonies. The overall acoustic energy and pulse length, rather than the power density, were key in eliciting the effects observed in vitro. The SDT treatment in combination with HPNP resulted in 21% and 27% reduction of the target and off-target tumour volumes, respectively, within 24&#160;h.

Risks of oral SPNs were defined by standardised incidence ratios (SIRs), absolute excess risks and cumulative incidence. One hundred and forty-five oral SPNs (64 salivary gland, 38 tongue, 20 pharynx, 2 lip, and 21 other) were ascertained among 143 survivors. Survivors were at 5-fold risk of an oral SPN (95% CI: 4.4-5.6).

Clinical studies on the covalent inhibitors of the KRASG12C mutant have reported promising results. However, primary and acquired resistance may limit their clinical use. Sotorasib-resistant cell lines were established. We explored the signalling pathways activated in these resistant cell lines and their roles in sotorasib resistance. The resistant cells exhibited increased cell-matrix adhesion with increased levels of stress fibres and focal adherens. p21-activated kinases (PAKs) were activated in resistant cells, which phosphorylate MEK at serine 298 of MEK and serine 338 of c-Raf to activate the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. The PAK inhibitors FRAX597 and FRAX486 in synergy with sotorasib reduced the viability of KRASG12C mutant cancer cells. Furthermore, the PI3K\/AKT pathway was constitutively active in sotorasib-resistant cells. The overexpression of constitutively activated PI3K or the knockdown of PTEN resulted in resistance to sotorasib. PI3K inhibitor alpelisib was synergistic with sotorasib in compromising the viability of KRASG12C mutant cancer cells. Moreover, PI3K and PAK pathways formed a mutual positive regulatory loop that mediated sotorasib resistance. Our results indicate that the cell-matrix interaction-dependent activation of PAK mediates resistance to sotorasib through the activation of MAPK and PI3K pathways.","query":"cancer"},"36319848":{"ArticleTitle":"Cutaneous melanoma, prostate-specific antigen testing and the subsequent risk of prostate cancer diagnosis: a prospective analysis of the 45 and Up Study.","AbstractText":"The association between cutaneous melanoma and subsequent risk of prostate cancer (PC) was examined in a large population-based cohort study.

Responses to the survey questions and participant characteristics were quantified and differences evaluated between geriatricians and geriatricians-in-training and between European regions. The 964 respondents (median age 42&#160;years old; 64% female; 21% geriatricians-in-training) were generally willing to deprescribe (98%) and felt confident about deprescribing (85%). Despite differences across European regions, the most commonly reported reasons for deprescribing were functional impairment and occurrence of adverse drug reactions. The most important barriers for deprescribing were patients' unwillingness, fear of negative consequences, lack of time, and poor communication between multiple prescribers. Perceived risk of adverse drug reactions was highest for psychotropic drugs, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, cardiovascular drugs, and opioid analgesics. Only one in four respondents (23% of geriatricians and 37% of geriatricians-in-training) think education in medical school had sufficiently prepared them for deprescribing in clinical practice. They reported that their future deprescribing activities would probably increase with improved information sharing between various prescribers, deprescribing recommendations in guidelines, and increased education and training. Approximately 90% think that a paradigm shift is required for prescribers and patients, increasing focus on the possible benefits of deprescribing (potentially) inappropriate medications. Based on the outcomes of this survey, we recommend investing in improved inter-professional communication, better education and evidence-based recommendations to improve future patient-centered deprescribing practices.","query":"cancer"},"36319832":{"ArticleTitle":"A novel refined pyroptosis and inflammasome-related genes signature for predicting prognosis and immune microenvironment in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.","AbstractText":"Pyroptosis is an inflammatory form of cell death, which plays a key role in the development of auto-inflammation and cancer. This study aimed to construct a pyroptosis and inflammasome-related genes for predicting prognosis of the pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). This study was based primarily on the one-way analysis of variance, univariate Cox regression analysis, Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) Cox regression, a risk-prognostic signature, gene set variation analysis (GSVA), and immune microenvironment analysis, using PDAC data from The Cancer Genome Atlas and International Cancer Genome Consortium databases for the analysis of the role of 676 pyroptosis and inflammasome-related genes in PDAC retrieved from the Reactome and GeneCards databases. Lastly, we collected six paired PDAC and matched normal adjacent tissue samples to verify the expression of signature genes by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). We identified 18 candidate pyroptosis and inflammasome-related genes that differed significantly between pathologic grades (stages) of PDAC patients. The univariate Cox and LASSO analyses pointed to six genes as the best variables for constructing a prognostic signature, including ACTA2, C1QTNF9, DNAH8, GATM, LBP, and NGF. The results of the risk prognostic model indicated that the AUCs at 1, 3, and 5&#160;years were greater than 0.62. GSVA revealed that 'GLYCOLYSIS', 'P53 PATHWAY', 'KRAS SIGNALING UP', and 'INFLAMMATORY RESPONSE' hallmark gene sets were associated with the risk score. The high-risk group was associated with poor prognosis and was characterized by a lower infiltration of cells involved in anti-tumor immunity; whereas the low-risk group with higher T cells, NK cells, and macrophages showed relatively better survival and significantly higher upregulation of cytolytic scores and inflammation scores. Additionally, crucial pyroptosis and inflammasome-related genes were further validated by qRT-PCR. Our study revealed the prognostic role of the pyroptosis and inflammasome-related genes in PDAC for the first time.

In this study, we identified and validated pharmacological mechanism involved in the treatment of GC with integrated approach of network pharmacology and molecular docking. The targets of andrographolide and GC were obtained from databases. The intersected targets between andrographolide and GC-related genes were used to construct protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. Furthermore, mechanism of action of the targets was predicted by Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses. Finally, these results were validated by molecular docking experiments, mRNA and protein expression level. A total of 197 targets were obtained for andrographolide treating GC. Functional enrichment analysis revealed that the target genes were exerted promising therapeutic effects on GC by HIF-1 and PI3K-Akt signaling pathway. The possible mechanism of action is by inactivation of HIF-1 signaling pathway which is dependent on the inhibition of upstream PI3K-AKT pathway. The PPI network identified SRC, AKT1, TP53, STAT3, PIK3CA, MAPK1, MAPK3, VEGFA, JUN and HSP90AA1 as potential hub targets.

They exhibit not only diverse chemical structures but also rich biological activities, such as anti-cancer, anti-microbial, anti-algae, anti-parasitic, pesticides, and UV radiation resistance. The preferred cytotoxicity to cancer cells rather than normal cells indicates a good biological selectivity and safety, which makes the prodiginines promising candidates for drug development and novel additives for food processing. Until now, 33 prodiginine natural products have been identified in various bacteria, including Serratia, Hahella, Pseudoalteromonas, Vibrio, Zooshikella, Streptomyces, and Actinomadura. However, most efforts are still focused on the star molecule prodigiosin, while little yet is known about other prodiginine members, which retards the research and application of prodiginine compounds. To gain insight into the prodiginine family, we reviewed the recent discoveries on their chemical structures, biosynthesis, biological activities, and mechanisms of action. We believe this article will provide a guideline for new research on prodiginines, such as the discovery of new congeners and drug development. KEY POINTS: &#8226; The prodiginines are a large family of natural products with a core structure of tripyrrole rings and exhibit various bioactivities. &#8226; The prodiginines have a widespread distribution among many environmental microbes and diverse biosynthetic pathways, indicating important ecological roles and a great potential for new congeners. &#8226; The potent biological activities and good selectivity of action make prodiginines good lead compounds for drug development.","query":"cancer"},"36319790":{"ArticleTitle":"Total 102 natural orifice specimen extraction following laparoscopic colorectal resections.","AbstractText":"Natural orifice surgery has been used with increasing frequency in colon surgeries since the early 2000's.

Breast cancer cell density alters considerably throughout the early stages of primary and secondary tumor development. Although cell density in culture influences kinetics, the effects of varying cell densities on the chemoresistance of breast cancer cells remains largely unexplored. We observed chemotherapeutics-induced differential gene and protein expression of ABC transporters in luminal and basal breast cancer cells cultured at low and high seeding densities. Low-density cultures depicted a significant increase in the mRNA expression of ABC transporters-ABCG2, ABCG1, ABCC4, ABCA2, ABCA3, ABCC2, ABCC3, ABCC6, ABCC7, and ABCC9 as compared with high-density cultures. Next, cells at both low and high seeding densities when pre-treated with cyclosporine A (CsA), a pan-inhibitor of ABC transporters, resulted in increased sensitization to chemotherapeutics-doxorubicin and tamoxifen at markedly low IC50 concentrations suggesting the role of ABC transporters. Finally, markedly high doxorubicin-drug accumulation, significantly increased expression of N-cadherin, and a significant decrease in chemotherapeutics-induced in vitro tumorigenesis was observed in low-density seeded breast cancer cells when pre-treated with CsA suggesting ABC transporters inhibition-mediated increased efficacy of chemotherapeutics. These findings suggest that breast cancer cells grown at low seeding density imparts chemoresistance towards doxorubicin or tamoxifen by a differential increase in the expression of ABC transporters. Thus, a combinatorial treatment strategy including ABC transporter inhibitors and chemotherapeutics can be a way forward for overcoming the breast cancer chemoresistance.","query":"cancer"},"36319786":{"ArticleTitle":"Bovine holo-lactoferrin inhibits migration and invasion in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells.","AbstractText":"Breast cancer is the most common malignancy in developed countries and the main cause of deaths in women worldwide.

The cytotoxicity of RUT-MSNs on the HN5 cells as head and neck cancer cells was evaluated. The expression level of apoptosis-related genes such as Bcl-2 and Bax genes were evaluated. In addition, ROS production of RUT-MSNs treated cells was assessed. In addition, minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), biofilm, and attachment inhibitory effects of RUT-MSNs compared with free rutin were assessed against different bacterial strains. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) showed mesoporous rod-shaped nanoparticles with an average particle size of less than 100&#160;nm. RUT-MSNs displayed the cytotoxic effect with IC50 of 20.23 &#181;M in 48&#160;h of incubation time (p&#8201;<&#8201;0.05).

ISG15 has only been identified in vertebrates, indicating that the functions of ISG15 and its conjugation are restricted to higher eukaryotes and have evolved with IFN signaling. Despite the highlighted complexity of ISG15 and ISGylation, it has been suggested that ISG15 and ISGylation profoundly impact a variety of cellular processes, including protein translation, autophagy, exosome secretion, cytokine secretion, cytoskeleton dynamics, DNA damage response, telomere shortening, and immune modulation, which emphasizes the necessity of reassessing ISG15 and ISGylation.

A&#160;distinction is made between the removal of regional lymph nodes, the sentinel lymph node and the radical removal of lymph nodes in a&#160;body region. Cervical, axillary, inguinal and iliac lymph nodes are clinically relevant. The strategy of sentinel lymph node dissection, in which the first lymph node in the drainage system is resected and histopathologically examined for malignant tissue, has brought decisive advantages for the patients, as radical lymphadenectomy with its severe morbidities is utilized in fewer cases. This can improve the patient's quality of life by sparing the lymphatic drainage pathways and reducing lymphedema, inflammation and wound healing disorders. In addition, a&#160;lymphadenectomy may be indicated as part of palliative interventions. Another form of lymph node removal is the vascularized lymph node transplantation, which is used for reconstructive purposes in lymphedema. Therefore lymph node grafts are transferred to the site where lymph nodes were previously removed.

Patients with advanced TGCT often exhibit a worse prognosis due to the acquisition of therapeutic resistance. Cisplatin-based chemotherapy is a standard treatment for advanced TGCTs initially sensitive to cisplatin, as exemplified by embryonal carcinoma. The acquisition of cisplatin resistance, however, could be a fatal obstacle for TGCT management. To identify cisplatin resistance-related genes, we performed transcriptome analysis for cisplatin-resistant TGCT cells compared to parental cells. In two types of cisplatin-resistant TGCT cell models that we established from patient-derived TGCT cells, and from the NEC8 cell line, we found that mRNA levels of the high-mobility-group nucleosome-binding gene HMGN5 and meiosis-related gene TEX11 were remarkably upregulated compared to those in the corresponding parental cells. We showed that either HMGN5 or TEX11 knockdown substantially reduced the viability of cisplatin-resistant TGCT cells in the presence of cisplatin. Notably, TEX11 silencing in cisplatin-resistant TGCT cells increased the level of cleaved PARP1 protein, and the percentage of double-strand break marker &#947;H2AX-positive cells.

Thus, the current study aimed at exploring how EVs derived from M2-polarized TAMs (M2-TAMs) affected the proliferation of ovarian cancer (OC) cells and apoptosis of CD8+ T cells. M2-TAMs were observed in OC tissues, which promoted proliferation of OC cells and CD8+ T cell apoptosis by secreting EVs.

The in vitro and in vivo effects of TAM-EVs-NEAT1 and its regulatory mechanism were assessed using gain- and loss-of-function assays in co-culture systems of TAMs-derived EVs, OC cells, and CD8+ T cells and in tumor-bearing mice. NEAT1 was highly expressed in M2-derived EVs and OC cells co-cultured with M2-derived EVs. NEAT1 sponged miR-101-3p to increase ZEB1 and PD-L1 expression. In vitro and in vivo assays confirmed the tumor-supporting effects of NEAT1 delivered by M2-derived EVs on OC cell proliferation and CD8+ T cell apoptosis as well as tumor growth.

In a subset of blood tests from the Mouse Phenome Database, dFI increased exponentially and predicted the remaining lifespan. The observation of the limiting dFI was consistent with the late-life mortality deceleration. dFI changed along with hallmarks of aging, including frailty index, molecular markers of inflammation, senescent cell accumulation, and responded to life-shortening (high-fat diet) and life-extending (rapamycin) treatments.","query":"cancer"},"36319634":{"ArticleTitle":"Profilin-1 regulates DNA replication forks in a context-dependent fashion by interacting with SNF2H and BOD1L.","AbstractText":"DNA replication forks are tightly controlled by a large protein network consisting of well-known core regulators and many accessory factors which remain functionally undefined. In this study, we report previously unknown nuclear functions of the actin-binding factor profilin-1 (PFN1) in DNA replication, which occur in a context-dependent fashion and require its binding to poly-L-proline (PLP)-containing proteins instead of actin. In unperturbed cells, PFN1 increases DNA replication initiation and accelerates fork progression by binding and stimulating the PLP-containing nucleosome remodeler SNF2H. Under replication stress, PFN1\/SNF2H increases fork stalling and functionally collaborates with fork reversal enzymes to enable the over-resection of unprotected forks. In addition, PFN1 binds and functionally attenuates the PLP-containing fork protector BODL1 to increase the resection of a subset of stressed forks. Accordingly, raising nuclear PFN1 level decreases genome stability and cell survival during replication stress. Thus, PFN1 is a multi-functional regulator of DNA replication with exploitable anticancer potential.","query":"cancer"},"36319633":{"ArticleTitle":"Monkeypox: epidemiology, pathogenesis, treatment and prevention.","AbstractText":"Monkeypox is a zoonotic disease that was once endemic in west and central Africa caused by monkeypox virus. However, cases recently have been confirmed in many nonendemic countries outside of Africa. WHO declared the ongoing monkeypox outbreak to be a public health emergency of international concern on July 23, 2022, in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. The rapidly increasing number of confirmed cases could pose a threat to the international community. Here, we review the epidemiology of monkeypox, monkeypox virus reservoirs, novel transmission patterns, mutations and mechanisms of viral infection, clinical characteristics, laboratory diagnosis and treatment measures. In addition, strategies for the prevention, such as vaccination of smallpox vaccine, is also included. Current epidemiological data indicate that high frequency of human-to-human transmission could lead to further outbreaks, especially among men who have sex with men. The development of antiviral drugs and vaccines against monkeypox virus is urgently needed, despite some therapeutic effects of currently used drugs in the clinic. We provide useful information to improve the understanding of monkeypox virus and give guidance for the government and relative agency to prevent and control the further spread of monkeypox virus.","query":"cancer"},"36319625":{"ArticleTitle":"In situ generation of micrometer-sized tumor cell-derived vesicles as autologous cancer vaccines for boosting systemic immune responses.","AbstractText":"Cancer vaccine, which can promote tumor-specific immunostimulation, is one of the most important immunotherapeutic strategies and holds tremendous potential for cancer treatment\/prevention.

We confirm in two tumor-bearing mouse models that the nanoparticles can restrain tumor growth, induce robust immunogenic cell death, and convert the primary tumor into an antigen depot by producing HMVs in situ to serve as personalized vaccines for cancer immunotherapy. Furthermore, the HDDT-healed mice show a&#160;strong immune memory effect and the HDDT treatment can realize long-term protection against tumor rechallenge. Collectively, the present work provides a general strategy for the preparation of tumor-associated antigen-containing vesicles and the development of personalized cancer vaccines.","query":"cancer"},"36319622":{"ArticleTitle":"Cancer-associated fibroblasts promote the stemness and progression of renal cell carcinoma via exosomal miR-181d-5p.","AbstractText":"The mechanisms underlying the effects of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) on cancer stemness and tumor progression in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) have not been elucidated yet. In the present study, we found that the enrichment of CAFs was positively associated with tumor progression and cancer stemness in RCC. Further investigation revealed that CAFs could enhance cancer stemness through delivering exosomes to RCC cells, and miR-181d-5p was identified as the critical exosomal miRNA in CAF-secreted exosomes by small RNA sequencing and subsequent screening assays. Mechanistically, exosomal miR-181d-5p transferred from CAFs to RCC cells directly suppressed the expression of ring finger protein 43 (RNF43) and activated Wnt\/&#946;-catenin signaling pathway, thus promoted cancer stemness and tumor progression. Overexpression of RNF43 strongly suppressed stemness properties and the effects could be reverted by miR-181d-5p. Overall, our findings revealed a crucial mechanism by which CAF-secreted exosomal miRNAs to enhance cancer stemness and thus promote RCC progression, suggesting a new avenue based on CAF-secreted miRNAs for more effective targeted therapies.","query":"cancer"},"36319618":{"ArticleTitle":"Gut microbiome dysbiosis in antibiotic-treated COVID-19 patients is associated with microbial translocation and bacteremia.","AbstractText":"Although microbial populations in the gut microbiome are associated with COVID-19 severity, a causal impact on patient health has not been established.

We first demonstrate SARS-CoV-2 infection induces gut microbiome dysbiosis in mice, which correlated with alterations to Paneth cells and goblet cells, and markers of barrier permeability. Samples collected from 96 COVID-19 patients at two different clinical sites also revealed substantial gut microbiome dysbiosis, including blooms of opportunistic pathogenic bacterial genera known to include antimicrobial-resistant species. Analysis of blood culture results testing for secondary microbial bloodstream infections with paired microbiome data indicates that bacteria may translocate from the gut into the systemic circulation of COVID-19 patients. These results are consistent with a direct role for gut microbiome dysbiosis in enabling dangerous secondary infections during COVID-19.","query":"cancer"},"36319601":{"ArticleTitle":"Modulation of Myeloid-derived Suppressor Cells by Long Non-coding RNAs in the Tumor Microenvironment and Tumorigenesis.","AbstractText":"Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) constitute an important component in regulating immune responses in cancer.

Efficacious approaches to prevent and treat obesity may reduce CRC incidence. Daily calorie restriction (Cal-R) is the most common approach to treating obesity, yet clinically meaningful weight loss is elusive owing to waning adherence. Time-restricted eating (TRE) consists of consuming foods within a specified time frame, creating a natural calorie deficit. TRE in animals shows cancer protective effects. In humans, TRE is safe and acceptable among adults with obesity, producing ~3% to 5% weight loss and reductions in oxidative stress and insulin resistance. However, TRE has not been tested rigorously for CRC preventive effects. The authors describe a 12-month randomized controlled trial of 8-hour TRE (ad libitum 12 PM-8 PM), Cal-R (25% restriction daily), or Control among 255 adults at increased risk for CRC and with obesity. Effects on the following will be examined: 1) body weight, body composition, and adherence; 2) circulating metabolic, inflammation, and oxidative stress biomarkers; 3) colonic mucosal gene expression profiles and tissue microenvironment; and 4) maintenance of benefits on body weight\/composition and CRC risk markers.

There are insufficient data to recommend for or against adjuvant systemic chemotherapy or RT, although the limited available data does not suggest apparent benefit in terms of OS.","query":"cancer"},"36319551":{"ArticleTitle":"\"Geriatricizing\" drug development - A Young International Society of Geriatric Oncology letter to the editor.","AbstractText":"","query":"cancer"},"36319537":{"ArticleTitle":"Lactic acid and lactate: revisiting the physiological roles in the tumor microenvironment.","AbstractText":"Lactic acid production has been regarded as a mechanism by which malignant cells escape immunosurveillance. Recent technological advances in mass spectrometry and the use of cell culture media with a physiological nutrient composition have shed new light on the role of lactic acid and its conjugate lactate in the tumor microenvironment. Here, we review novel work identifying lactate as a physiological carbon source for mammalian tumors and immune cells. We highlight evidence that its use as a substrate is distinct from the immunosuppressive acidification of the extracellular milieu by lactic acid protons. Together, data suggest that neutralizing the effects of intratumoral acidity while maintaining physiological lactate metabolism in cytotoxic CD8+ T cells should be pursued to boost anti-tumor immunity.","query":"cancer"},"36319517":{"ArticleTitle":"Predicting Meningioma Resection Status: Use of Deep Learning.","AbstractText":"","query":"cancer"},"36319515":{"ArticleTitle":"VMAT partial arc technique decreases dose to organs at risk in whole pelvic radiotherapy for prostate cancer when compared to full arc VMAT and IMRT.","AbstractText":"Whole pelvic radiotherapy (WPRT) can sterilize microscopic lymph node metastases in treatment of prostate cancer. WPRT, compared to prostate only radiotherapy (PORT), is associated with increased acute gastrointestinal, and hematological toxicities. To further explore minimizing normal tissue toxicities associated with WPRT in definitive IMRT for prostate cancer, this planning study compared dosimetric differences between static 9-field-IMRT, full arc VMAT, and mixed partial-full arc VMAT techniques. In this retrospective study, 12 prostate cancer patients who met the criteria for WPRT were randomly selected for this study. The initial volume, PTV46, included the prostate, seminal vesicles, and pelvic nodes with margin and was prescribed to 4600&#160;cGy. The cone-down volume, PTV78, included the prostate and proximal seminal vesicles with margin to a total dose of 7800&#160;cGy. For each CT image set, 3 plans were generated for each of the PTVs: an IMRT plan, a full arc (FA) VMAT plan, and a mixed partial-full arc (PFA) VMAT plan, using 6MV photons energy. According to RTOG protocols none of the plans had a major Conformity Index (CI) violation by any of the 3 planning techniques. PFA plan had the best mean CI index of 1.00 and significantly better than IMRT (p&#8239;=&#8239;0.03) and FA (p&#8239;=&#8239;0.007). For equivalent PTV coverage, the average composite gradient index of the PFA plans was better than the IMRT and the FA plans with values 1.92, 2.03, and 2.01 respectively. The defference was statistically significant between PFA\/IMRT and PFA\/FA, with p- values of < 0.001. The IMRT plans and the PFA plans provided very similar doses to the rectum, bladder, sigmoid colon, and femoral heads, which were lower than the dose in the FA plans. There was a significant decrease in the mean dose to the rectum from 4524 cGy with the FA to 4182&#160;cGy with the PFA and 4091&#160;cGy with IMRT (p < 0.001). The percent of rectum receiving 4000&#160;cGy was also the highest with FA at 66.1% compared to 49.9% (PFA) and 47.5% (IMRT). There was a significant decrease in the mean dose to the bladder from 3922&#160;cGy (FA) to 3551&#160;cGy (PFA) and 3612&#160;cGy (IMRT) (p < 0.001). The percent of bladder receiving 4000&#160;cGy was also the highest with FA at 45.4% compared to 36.6% (PFA) and 37.4% (IMRT). The average mean dose to the sigmoid colon decreased from 4177&#160;cGy (FA) to 3893&#160;cGy (PFA) and 3819&#160;cGy (IMRT). The average mean dose to the femoral heads decreased from 2091&#160;cGy (FA) to 2026&#160;cGy (PFA) and 1987&#160;cGy (IMRT). Considering the improvement in plan quality indices recorded in this study including the dose gradient and the dose to organs at risk, mixed partial-full arc plans may be the preferred VMAT treatment technique over full arc plans for prostate cancer treatments that include nodal volumes.","query":"cancer"},"36319510":{"ArticleTitle":"Quitline Promotion to Medicaid Members Who Smoke: Effects of COVID-19-Specific Messaging and a Free Patch Offer.","AbstractText":"People who smoke are at increased risk of serious COVID-19-related disease but have had reduced access to cessation treatment during the pandemic. This study tested 2 approaches to promoting quitline services to Medicaid members who smoke at high rates: using COVID-19-specific messaging and offering free nicotine patches. The hypotheses were that both would increase enrollment. A California Medicaid mailing from October 2020 to January 2021 (N=7,489,093) included 4 versions of a flyer following a 2&#160;&#215;&#160;2 design comparing generic with COVID-19-specific messaging and a no-patch with free-patch offer. The main outcome measure was quitline enrollments. Quit outcomes (attempted quitting, quit &#8805;7 days, quit &#8805;30 days) were assessed at 2 months. A subsequent free-patch offer was sent to all members (N=7,577,198) from April 2021 to June 2021. Data were collected in 2020-2021 and analyzed in 2022. The first mailing generated 1,753 enrollments. Response rates were 0.023% and 0.024% for generic and COVID-19-specific messaging, respectively (p=0.538), and 0.006% and 0.041% for no-patch and free-patch offers, respectively, the latter being 6.7 times more effective than the former (p<0.0001). Quit outcomes were comparable across conditions. The subsequent free-patch offer generated 3,546 enrollments at $40.28 per enrollee. In a Medicaid mailing during COVID-19, offering free patches generated more than 6 times as many quitline enrollments as offering generic help. COVID-19-specific messaging was no more effective than generic messaging. Offering free patches was highly cost-effective. Medicaid programs partnering with quitlines should consider using similar strategies, especially during a pandemic when regular health care is disrupted.","query":"cancer"},"36319507":{"ArticleTitle":"The Use of Intraoperative Ultrasound During Breast Conserving Surgery.","AbstractText":"The purpose of this study is to evaluate the utilization of intraoperative ultrasound (IOUS) for tumor localization in breast-conserving surgery and to examine its impact on margin positivity and re-excision rates. Additionally, the study seeks to identify factors contributing to surgeon utilization of IOUS. A retrospective chart review was conducted of patients with preoperative diagnosis of breast cancer undergoing breast-conserving surgery by breast surgeons at multiple centers within a single healthcare system. Characteristics such as lesion size, palpability, histology, receptor status, and use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy were recorded. Re-excision rates were determined based on localization technique and surgeons' status of breast ultrasound certification. A total of 671 cases were performed, with 322 meeting study inclusion. 57 cases utilized IOUS, 250 utilized preoperative wire-guided localization (WGL), 10 used both methods and 5 cases used neither method. There was no significant difference in re-excision rates between IOUS and WGL or among the four surgeons. Ultrasound-certified surgeons were more likely to utilize IOUS, and re-excision rates trended higher for WGL, which may be clinically significant. Increasing familiarity with and utilization of IOUS during breast-conserving surgery may be clinically advantageous over traditional localization techniques. Ultrasound certification may lead to increased use of IOUS among surgeons.","query":"cancer"},"36319485":{"ArticleTitle":"The Ring Study: an international comparison of PD-L1 diagnostic assays and their interpretation in non-small cell lung cancer, head and neck squamous cell cancer and urothelial cancer.","AbstractText":"PD-L1 immunohistochemistry has been approved as a diagnostic assay for immunotherapy. However, an international comparison across multiple cancers is lacking. This study aimed to assess the performance of PD-L1 diagnostic assays in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), head and neck squamous cell cancer (HNSCC) and urothelial cancer (UC). The excisional specimens of NSCLC, HNSCC and UC were assayed by Ventana SP263 and scored at three sites in each country, including Australia, Brazil, Korea, Mexico, Russia and Taiwan. All slides were rotated to two other sites for interobserver scoring. The same cohort of NSCLC was assessed with Dako 22C3 pharmDx PD-L1 for comparison. The PD-L1 immunopositivity was scored according to the approved PD-L1 scoring algorithms which were the percentage of PD-L1-expressing tumour cell (TC) and tumour proportion score (TPS) by Ventana SP263 and Dako 22C3 staining, respectively. In NSCLC, the comparison demonstrated the comparability of the SP263 and 22C3 assays (cut-off of 1%, &#954;=0.71; 25%, &#954;=0.75; 50%, &#954;=0.81). The interobserver comparisons showed moderate to almost perfect agreement for SP263 in TC staining at 25% cut-off (NSCLC, &#954;=0.72 to 0.86; HNSCC, &#954;=0.60 to 0.82; UC, &#954;=0.68 to 0.91) and at 50% cut-off for NSCLC (&#954;=0.64 to 0.90).

The interchangeability of SP263 and 22C3 in NSCLC might be acceptable, especially at the 50% cut-off. In HNSCC, the performance of SP263 is comparable across five countries. In UC, there was low concordance of IC staining, which may affect treatment decisions.

Methods: Patients with International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage &#8544;-&#8546; GTN receiving primary chemotherapy in Peking Union Medical College Hospital between July 2014 and December 2018 were retrospectively analyzed and divided into group 1 with lung metastasis and group 2 without lung metastasis. The baseline characteristics and treatment outcomes of the two groups were compared. The optimal cut-off values of the diameter of largest lung nodule associated with recurrence were identified by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Logistic regression analyses were performed to identify risk factors for prognosis. Survival analysis was performed by Kaplan-Meier method and Log rank test. Results: Of the 381 GTN patients enrolled (216 with lung metastases and 165 without lung metastases), the pretreatment &#946; human chorionic gonadotrophin [median: 12 572 IU\/L (1 832-51 594 IU\/L) vs. 5 614 IU\/L (559-26 140 IU\/L), P=0.001] and FIGO score [median: 3 (1-6) vs. 2 (1-4), P=0.038] were significantly higher in patients with lung metastases than those without lung metastases. In patients with FIGO score&#8805;5, the emergence of resistance (26.76% vs. 10.26%, P=0.036) and median number of chemotherapy courses to achieve complete remission [6 (6-8) vs. 5 (4-6), P<0.001] were significantly higher than patients with lung metastases. In patients with FIGO score 0-4, no significant difference was found in the treatment outcomes between the two groups(P=0.833). Among all patients with lung metastases, the ROC curve showed a sensitivity and specificity of 62.5% and 78.8%, respectively, for predicting recurrence when the length of the largest lung nodule was 1.6 cm, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.711 (95% CI: 0.550, 0.871, P=0.044). Multivariate logistic regression analysis suggested a significantly higher recurrence rate when the largest lung nodule was &#8805;1.6 cm (OR=7.394, 95% CI: 1.003, 54.520, P=0.049). The 1-year disease-free survival rate was significantly lower in patients with the largest lung nodule &#8805;1.6 cm than in patients with the nodule <1.6 cm (98.2% vs. 82.4%, P=0.001). Conclusions: Lung metastasis is associated with increased first-line chemotherapy resistance in patients with FIGO scores&#8805;5. The diameter of the largest lung metastatic nodule &#8805;1.6 cm is an effective factor for predicting recurrence. &#30446;&#30340;&#65306;&#25506;&#35752;&#32954;&#36716;&#31227;&#23545;&#22922;&#23072;&#28363;&#20859;&#32454;&#32990;&#32959;&#30244;(GTN)&#24739;&#32773;&#39044;&#21518;&#30340;&#24433;&#21709;&#12290; &#26041;&#27861;&#65306;&#36873;&#21462;2014&#24180;7&#26376;&#33267;2018&#24180;12&#26376;&#20110;&#21271;&#20140;&#21327;&#21644;&#21307;&#38498;&#21021;&#27835;&#30340;&#22269;&#38469;&#22919;&#20135;&#31185;&#32852;&#30431;&#8544;~&#8546;&#26399;GTN&#24739;&#32773;&#65292;&#26681;&#25454;&#26377;&#26080;&#32954;&#36716;&#31227;&#20998;&#20026;&#32954;&#36716;&#31227;&#32452;&#21644;&#26080;&#32954;&#36716;&#31227;&#32452;&#65292;&#27604;&#36739;&#20004;&#32452;&#38388;&#30340;&#22522;&#32447;&#29305;&#24449;&#21644;&#27835;&#30103;&#25928;&#26524;&#65292;&#37319;&#29992;&#21463;&#35797;&#32773;&#24037;&#20316;&#29305;&#24449;(ROC)&#26354;&#32447;&#30830;&#23450;&#32954;&#36716;&#31227;&#26368;&#22823;&#32467;&#33410;&#38271;&#24452;&#39044;&#27979;&#22797;&#21457;&#30340;&#26368;&#20339;&#20020;&#30028;&#20540;&#65292;&#39044;&#21518;&#24433;&#21709;&#22240;&#32032;&#20998;&#26512;&#37319;&#29992;logistic&#22238;&#24402;&#20998;&#26512;&#65292;&#29983;&#23384;&#20998;&#26512;&#37319;&#29992;Kaplan&#65293;Meier&#27861;&#21644;Log rank&#26816;&#39564;&#12290; &#32467;&#26524;&#65306; 381&#20363;GTN&#24739;&#32773;&#20013;&#65292;&#32954;&#36716;&#31227;&#32452;216&#20363;&#65292;&#26080;&#32954;&#36716;&#31227;&#32452;165&#20363;&#12290;&#32954;&#36716;&#31227;&#32452;&#24739;&#32773;&#21270;&#30103;&#21069;&#20013;&#20301;&#946;&#20154;&#32466;&#27611;&#33180;&#20419;&#24615;&#33146;&#28608;&#32032;&#27700;&#24179;[12 572 IU\/L(1 832~51 594 IU\/L)]&#39640;&#20110;&#26080;&#32954;&#36716;&#31227;&#24739;&#32773;[5 614 IU\/L(559~26 140 IU\/L)&#65292;P&#65309;0.001]&#12290;&#32954;&#36716;&#31227;&#32452;&#24739;&#32773;&#30340;&#20013;&#20301;&#39044;&#21518;&#35780;&#20998;&#20998;&#25968;[3&#20998;(1~6&#20998;)]&#39640;&#20110;&#26080;&#32954;&#36716;&#31227;&#32452;[2&#20998;(1~4&#20998;)&#65292;P&#65309;0.038]&#12290;&#22312;&#39044;&#21518;&#35780;&#20998;&#8805;5&#20998;&#30340;&#24739;&#32773;&#20013;&#65292;&#32954;&#36716;&#31227;&#32452;&#21644;&#26080;&#32954;&#36716;&#31227;&#32452;&#24739;&#30340;&#27835;&#30103;&#32467;&#23616;&#24046;&#24322;&#26377;&#32479;&#35745;&#23398;&#24847;&#20041;(P&#65309;0.036)&#65292;&#32954;&#36716;&#31227;&#32452;&#24739;&#32773;&#19968;&#32447;&#21270;&#30103;&#36798;&#21040;&#23436;&#20840;&#32531;&#35299;&#30340;&#20013;&#20301;&#30103;&#31243;&#25968;[6&#20010;(6~8&#20010;)]&#39640;&#20110;&#26080;&#32954;&#36716;&#31227;&#32452;[5&#20010;(4~6&#20010;)&#65292;P<0.001]&#12290;&#22312;&#39044;&#21518;&#35780;&#20998;0~4&#20998;&#30340;&#24739;&#32773;&#20013;&#65292;&#32954;&#36716;&#31227;&#32452;&#21644;&#26080;&#32954;&#36716;&#31227;&#32452;&#30340;&#27835;&#30103;&#32467;&#23616;&#24046;&#24322;&#26080;&#32479;&#35745;&#23398;&#24847;&#20041;(P&#65309;0.833)&#12290;ROC&#26354;&#32447;&#26174;&#31034;&#65292;&#24403;&#32954;&#36716;&#31227;&#26368;&#22823;&#32467;&#33410;&#38271;&#24452;&#20026;1.6 cm&#26102;&#65292;&#39044;&#27979;&#22797;&#21457;&#30340;&#28789;&#25935;&#24230;&#21644;&#29305;&#24322;&#24230;&#20998;&#21035;&#20026;62.5%&#21644;78.8%&#65292;&#26354;&#32447;&#19979;&#38754;&#31215;&#20026;0.711(95% CI&#65306;0.550~0.871&#65292;P&#65309;0.044)&#12290;&#22810;&#22240;&#32032;&#20998;&#26512;&#26174;&#31034;&#65292;&#32954;&#36716;&#31227;&#26368;&#22823;&#32467;&#33410;&#38271;&#24452;&#8805;1.6 cm&#20026;&#22797;&#21457;&#30340;&#29420;&#31435;&#21361;&#38505;&#22240;&#32032;(OR&#65309;7.394&#65292;95% CI&#65306;1.003~54.520&#65292;P&#65309;0.049)&#12290;&#32954;&#36716;&#31227;&#26368;&#22823;&#32467;&#33410;&#38271;&#24452;&#8805;1.6 cm&#24739;&#32773;&#30340;1&#24180;&#26080;&#30149;&#29983;&#23384;&#29575;(82.4%)&#20302;&#20110;&#32954;&#36716;&#31227;&#26368;&#22823;&#32467;&#33410;&#38271;&#24452;<1.6 cm&#30340;&#24739;&#32773;(98.2%&#65292;P&#65309;0.001)&#12290; &#32467;&#35770;&#65306;&#21333;&#32431;&#23384;&#22312;&#30340;&#32954;&#36716;&#31227;&#26159;GTN&#39044;&#21518;&#35780;&#20998;&#8805;5&#20998;&#24739;&#32773;&#19968;&#32447;&#21270;&#30103;&#32784;&#33647;&#30340;&#21361;&#38505;&#22240;&#32032;&#65307;&#23384;&#22312;&#32954;&#36716;&#31227;&#26102;&#65292;&#32954;&#36716;&#31227;&#26368;&#22823;&#32467;&#33410;&#38271;&#24452;&#8805;1.6 cm&#26159;&#39044;&#27979;&#30142;&#30149;&#22797;&#21457;&#30340;&#29420;&#31435;&#24433;&#21709;&#22240;&#32032;&#12290;.","query":"cancer"},"36319460":{"ArticleTitle":"[Relationship between metastasis in the para-aortic lymph nodes of cervical cancer and pathological features].","AbstractText":"Objective: To investigate the incidence and the related risk factors of para-aortic lymph node metastasis in cervical cancer.

Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the clinical data of 148 CEC patients who treated with definitive radiotherapy in Cancer Hospital of Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences from January 2001 to December 2017. The median radiation dose was 66 Gy (59.4-70 Gy) and 33.1% of patients received concurrent chemotherapy. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to calculate survival rates. The log rank test was used for survival comparison and univariate prognostic analysis. The Cox model was used for multivariate prognostic analysis. Results: The median follow-up time was 102.6 months. The median survival time, 2- and 5-year overall survival (OS) were 22.7 months, 49.9% and 28.3%. The median, 2- and 5-year progression-free survival were 12.6 months, 35.8% and 25.8%. The 2- and 5-year locoregional recurrence-free survival were 59.1% and 50.8%. The 2- and 5-year distant metastases-free survival were 74.6% and 65.9%. Multivariate analysis showed that EQD(2)>66 Gy was the only independent prognostic indicator for OS (P=0.040). The median survival time and 5-year OS rate significantly improved in patients who received EQD(2)>66 Gy than those who received&#8804;66 Gy (31.2 months vs. 19.2 months, 40.1% vs. 19.1%, P=0.027). A total of 87 patients (58.8%) developed tumor progression. There were 50 (33.8%), 23 (15.5%) and 39 (26.4%) patients developed local, regional recurrence and distant metastases, respectively. Eleven patients (7.4%) underwent salvage surgery, and the laryngeal preservation rate for entire group was 93.9%. Conclusions: Definitive radiotherapy is an effective treatment for cervical esophageal carcinoma with the advantage of larynx preservation. Local recurrence is the major failure pattern. EQD(2)>66 Gy is associated with the improved overall survival. &#30446;&#30340;&#65306;&#25506;&#35752;&#39048;&#27573;&#39135;&#31649;&#30284;&#26681;&#27835;&#24615;&#25918;&#30103;&#30340;&#38271;&#26399;&#30103;&#25928;&#12289;&#27835;&#30103;&#22833;&#36133;&#27169;&#24335;&#21450;&#39044;&#21518;&#24433;&#21709;&#22240;&#32032;&#12290; &#26041;&#27861;&#65306;&#22238;&#39038;&#24615;&#20998;&#26512;2001&#24180;1&#26376;&#33267;2017&#24180;12&#26376;&#20110;&#20013;&#22269;&#21307;&#23398;&#31185;&#23398;&#38498;&#32959;&#30244;&#21307;&#38498;&#35786;&#27835;&#30340;148&#20363;&#39048;&#27573;&#39135;&#31649;&#40158;&#30284;&#24739;&#32773;&#30340;&#20020;&#24202;&#36164;&#26009;&#12290;&#20840;&#32452;148&#20363;&#24739;&#32773;&#30340;&#20013;&#20301;&#25918;&#30103;&#21058;&#37327;&#20026;66.0 Gy(59.4~70.0 Gy)&#65292;33.1%(49\/148)&#30340;&#24739;&#32773;&#36827;&#34892;&#20102;&#21516;&#27493;&#21270;&#30103;&#12290;&#37319;&#29992;Kaplan&#65293;Meier&#27861;&#35745;&#31639;&#29983;&#23384;&#29575;&#65292;Log rank&#26816;&#39564;&#27604;&#36739;&#29983;&#23384;&#24046;&#24322;&#21450;&#21333;&#22240;&#32032;&#20998;&#26512;&#65292;&#22810;&#22240;&#32032;&#20998;&#26512;&#37319;&#29992;Cox&#27604;&#20363;&#39118;&#38505;&#22238;&#24402;&#27169;&#22411;&#12290; &#32467;&#26524;&#65306;&#20840;&#32452;148&#20363;&#24739;&#32773;&#30340;&#20013;&#20301;&#38543;&#35775;&#26102;&#38388;&#20026;102.6&#20010;&#26376;&#65292;&#20013;&#20301;&#29983;&#23384;&#26102;&#38388;&#20026;22.7&#20010;&#26376;&#65292;2&#12289;5&#24180;&#29983;&#23384;&#29575;&#20998;&#21035;&#20026;49.9%&#21644;28.3%&#65307;&#30142;&#30149;&#20013;&#20301;&#36827;&#23637;&#26102;&#38388;&#20026;12.6&#20010;&#26376;&#65292;2&#12289;5&#24180;&#26080;&#36827;&#23637;&#29983;&#23384;&#29575;&#20998;&#21035;&#20026;35.8%&#21644;25.8%&#65307;2&#12289;5&#24180;&#26080;&#23616;&#37096;&#21306;&#22495;&#22797;&#21457;&#29983;&#23384;&#29575;&#20998;&#21035;&#20026;59.1%&#21644;50.8%&#65307;2&#12289;5&#24180;&#26080;&#36828;&#22788;&#36716;&#31227;&#29983;&#23384;&#29575;&#20998;&#21035;&#20026;74.6%&#21644;65.9%&#12290;&#22810;&#22240;&#32032;&#20998;&#26512;&#26174;&#31034;&#65292;2 Gy&#20998;&#27425;&#25918;&#30103;&#31561;&#25928;&#21058;&#37327;(EQD(2))>66 Gy&#26159;&#24433;&#21709;&#24635;&#29983;&#23384;&#30340;&#29420;&#31435;&#39044;&#21518;&#22240;&#32032;(P&#65309;0.040)&#12290;EQD(2)>66 Gy&#24739;&#32773;&#30340;&#20013;&#20301;&#29983;&#23384;&#26102;&#38388;(31.2&#20010;&#26376;)&#21644;5&#24180;&#29983;&#23384;&#29575;(40.1%)&#20248;&#20110;EQD(2)&#8804;66 Gy&#24739;&#32773;(&#20998;&#21035;&#20026;19.2&#20010;&#26376;&#21644;19.1%&#65292;P&#65309;0.027)&#12290;&#20840;&#32452;148&#20363;&#24739;&#32773;&#20013;&#65292;&#27835;&#30103;&#22833;&#36133;87&#20363;(58.8%)&#65292;&#23616;&#37096;&#22797;&#21457;50&#20363;(33.8%)&#65292;&#21306;&#22495;&#22797;&#21457;23&#20363;(15.5%)&#65292;&#36828;&#22788;&#36716;&#31227;39&#20363;(26.4%)&#12290;11&#20363;(7.4%&#65292;11\/148)&#24739;&#32773;&#34892;&#25405;&#25937;&#24615;&#25163;&#26415;&#27835;&#30103;&#65292;&#20840;&#32452;&#20445;&#21897;&#29575;&#20026;93.9%(139\/148)&#12290; &#32467;&#35770;&#65306;&#26681;&#27835;&#24615;&#25918;&#30103;&#26159;&#39048;&#27573;&#39135;&#31649;&#30284;&#30340;&#26377;&#25928;&#27835;&#30103;&#25163;&#27573;&#19988;&#20855;&#26377;&#20445;&#21897;&#20248;&#21183;&#65292;&#23616;&#37096;&#22797;&#21457;&#26159;&#20027;&#35201;&#30340;&#27835;&#30103;&#22833;&#36133;&#27169;&#24335;&#65292;&#20104;&#20197;&#32959;&#30244;EQD(2)>66 Gy&#30340;&#25918;&#30103;&#21058;&#37327;&#26377;&#21033;&#20110;&#25552;&#39640;&#24739;&#32773;&#30340;&#24635;&#29983;&#23384;&#29575;&#12290;.","query":"cancer"},"36319458":{"ArticleTitle":"[Relationship between dynamic changes of psychological distress and quality of life in Chinese early breast cancer patients].","AbstractText":"Objective: To explore the dynamic changes of Distress Thermometer scores and the relationship between psychological distress and quality of life in Chinese early breast cancer patients during chemotherapy. Methods: This prospective study enrolled 110 Chinese postoperative early breast cancer patients between March 2019 and December 2019. The psychological distress and quality of life (QOL) of patients were assessed by using the psychological distress management screening tool and the patient quality of life scale. Logistic regression model was used to analyze the influencing factors of psychological distress degree. The correlation between distress thermometer (DT) score changes and quality of life was analyzed by Pearson correlation analysis. Results: In total, 96 valid cases were analyzed. Before chemotherapy, 47 cases (49.0%) had DT score &#8805;4 points. After 2 cycles of chemotherapy, 40 cases (41.7%) had DT score &#8805;4 points. Thirty-four patients (35.4%) had DT score &#8805;4 points after chemotherapy. The DT score after chemotherapy was lower than that before chemotherapy and after 2 cycles of chemotherapy. Univariate analysis showed that income level and pathological stage were still significant related to the detection of DT score &#8805;4 points after chemotherapy (P<0.05). The changes of DT scores before and after chemotherapy were negatively correlated with the changes of quality of life ( r=-0.298, P=0.003). Conclusions: The detection rate of psychological distress in patients with early breast cancer during chemotherapy showed a decreasing trend. Income level and tumor stage are significant factors affecting the psychological distress of patients. There is a significant correlation between the psychological distress and the quality of life during chemotherapy. We should pay attention to the evaluation and monitoring state of psychological distress of patients during chemotherapy. &#30446;&#30340;&#65306;&#20998;&#26512;&#20013;&#22269;&#26089;&#26399;&#20083;&#33146;&#30284;&#24739;&#32773;&#21270;&#30103;&#26399;&#38388;&#24515;&#29702;&#30171;&#33510;&#20998;&#20540;&#21160;&#24577;&#21464;&#21270;&#21450;&#24515;&#29702;&#30171;&#33510;&#24773;&#20917;&#19982;&#29983;&#27963;&#36136;&#37327;&#30340;&#20851;&#31995;&#12290; &#26041;&#27861;&#65306;&#25910;&#38598;2019&#24180;3&#8212;12&#26376;&#20110;&#21271;&#20140;&#24066;&#26397;&#38451;&#21306;&#26707;&#20852;&#32959;&#30244;&#21307;&#38498;&#39318;&#27425;&#25509;&#21463;&#26415;&#21518;&#36741;&#21161;&#21270;&#30103;&#30340;110&#20363;&#22899;&#24615;&#20083;&#33146;&#30284;&#24739;&#32773;&#30340;&#20020;&#24202;&#30149;&#29702;&#36164;&#26009;&#12290;&#37319;&#29992;&#24515;&#29702;&#30171;&#33510;&#31649;&#29702;&#31579;&#26597;&#24037;&#20855;&#21644;&#30284;&#30151;&#24739;&#32773;&#29983;&#27963;&#36136;&#37327;&#34920;&#35780;&#20272;&#24739;&#32773;&#30340;&#24515;&#29702;&#30171;&#33510;&#29366;&#20917;&#21644;&#29983;&#27963;&#36136;&#37327;&#24773;&#20917;&#12290;&#24433;&#21709;&#22240;&#32032;&#20998;&#26512;&#37319;&#29992;logistic&#22238;&#24402;&#20998;&#26512;&#65292;&#30456;&#20851;&#20998;&#26512;&#37319;&#29992;Person&#30456;&#20851;&#20998;&#26512;&#12290; &#32467;&#26524;&#65306; 96&#20363;&#24739;&#32773;&#30340;&#26377;&#25928;&#38382;&#21367;&#32467;&#26524;&#26174;&#31034;&#65292;&#21270;&#30103;&#21069;&#24515;&#29702;&#30171;&#33510;&#24471;&#20998;&#8805;4&#20998;&#32773;&#21344;49.0%(47&#20363;)&#65292;&#21270;&#30103;2&#20010;&#21608;&#26399;&#21518;&#24515;&#29702;&#30171;&#33510;&#24471;&#20998;&#8805;4&#20998;&#32773;&#21344;41.7%(40&#20363;)&#65292;&#23436;&#25104;&#25972;&#20010;&#21270;&#30103;&#21608;&#26399;&#21518;&#24515;&#29702;&#30171;&#33510;&#24471;&#20998;&#8805;4&#20998;&#32773;&#21344;35.4%(34&#20363;)&#12290;&#21270;&#30103;&#21518;&#30171;&#33510;&#28201;&#24230;&#35745;(DT)&#24471;&#20998;&#21576;&#36880;&#28176;&#19979;&#38477;&#36235;&#21183;&#12290;&#22810;&#22240;&#32032;&#20998;&#26512;&#26174;&#31034;&#65292;&#24739;&#32773;&#30340;&#26376;&#25910;&#20837;&#27700;&#24179;&#12289;&#32959;&#30244;&#20998;&#26399;&#19982;&#21270;&#30103;&#32467;&#26463;&#21518;&#24515;&#29702;&#30171;&#33510;&#21457;&#29983;&#26377;&#20851;(&#22343;P<0.05)&#65292;&#26376;&#25910;&#20837;&#27700;&#24179;&#36234;&#39640;&#21644;&#32959;&#30244;&#20998;&#26399;&#36234;&#26202;&#30340;&#24739;&#32773;&#36234;&#23481;&#26131;&#20135;&#29983;&#24515;&#29702;&#30171;&#33510;&#12290;&#24739;&#32773;&#21270;&#30103;&#21069;&#12289;&#21270;&#30103;&#21518;&#30340;DT&#24046;&#20540;&#19982;&#29983;&#27963;&#36136;&#37327;&#24046;&#20540;&#21576;&#36127;&#30456;&#20851;(r&#65309;&#65293;0.298&#65292;P&#65309;0.003)&#12290; &#32467;&#35770;&#65306;&#26089;&#26399;&#20083;&#33146;&#30284;&#24739;&#32773;&#21270;&#30103;&#26399;&#38388;&#24515;&#29702;&#30171;&#33510;&#26816;&#20986;&#29575;&#21576;&#19979;&#38477;&#36235;&#21183;&#65292;&#26376;&#25910;&#20837;&#27700;&#24179;&#21644;&#32959;&#30244;&#20998;&#26399;&#26159;&#24433;&#21709;&#24739;&#32773;&#24515;&#29702;&#30171;&#33510;&#30340;&#29420;&#31435;&#24433;&#21709;&#22240;&#32032;&#12290;&#24739;&#32773;&#21270;&#30103;&#26399;&#38388;&#24515;&#29702;&#30171;&#33510;&#19982;&#29983;&#27963;&#36136;&#37327;&#26377;&#20851;&#65292;&#24515;&#29702;&#30171;&#33510;&#31243;&#24230;&#36234;&#20302;&#12289;&#29983;&#27963;&#36136;&#37327;&#36234;&#39640;&#65292;&#24212;&#21152;&#24378;&#23545;&#26089;&#26399;&#20083;&#33146;&#30284;&#24739;&#32773;&#21270;&#30103;&#26399;&#38388;&#24515;&#29702;&#30171;&#33510;&#29366;&#24577;&#30340;&#35780;&#20272;&#30417;&#27979;&#12290;.","query":"cancer"},"36319457":{"ArticleTitle":"[Prevalence and risk factors of coronary artery calcification on lung cancer screening with low-dose CT].","AbstractText":"Objective: To investigate the prevalence and risk factors of coronary artery calcification (CAC) on lung cancer screening with low-dose computed tomography (LDCT). Methods: A total of 4 989 asymptomatic subjects (2 542 males and 2 447 females) who underwent LDCT lung cancer screening were recruited at Cancer Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences from 2014 to 2017. The visual scoring method was used to assess coronary artery calcification score. &#967;(2) test or independent t-test was used to compare the difference of CAC positive rate among different groups. Multivariate logistic regression was used to analyze risk factors associated with CAC in the study. Results: Of the 4 989 asymptomatic subjects, CAC occurred in 1 018 cases. The positive rate was 20.4%, of which mild, moderate and severe calcification accounted for 86.3%, 11.4% and 2.3%, respectively. Gender, age, BMI, education level, occupation, smoking history, diabetes, hypertension and hyperlipidemia had statistically significant differences in CAC positive rates among groups. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that gender, age, diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia and smoking history were risk factors for CAC. Age, diabetes, hypertension and smoking history were statistically significant risk factors between the mild and moderate CAC group. A total of 1 730 coronary arteries in 1 018 CAC positive cases had calcification, CAC positive rate of left anterior descending was the highest(51.3%); 568 cases (55.8%) were single vessel calcification, 450 cases (44.2%) were multiple vessel calcification. Conclusions: LDCT can be used for the 'one-stop' early detection of lung cancer and coronary atherosclerosis. Gender, age, diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia and smoking are related risk factors for coronary atherosclerosis. &#30446;&#30340;&#65306;&#25506;&#35752;&#20302;&#21058;&#37327;CT(LDCT)&#32954;&#30284;&#31579;&#26597;&#20154;&#32676;&#20896;&#29366;&#21160;&#33033;&#38041;&#21270;(CAC)&#30340;&#21457;&#29983;&#24773;&#20917;&#21450;&#20854;&#30456;&#20851;&#21361;&#38505;&#22240;&#32032;&#12290; &#26041;&#27861;&#65306;&#36873;&#21462;2014&#8212;2017&#24180;&#22312;&#20013;&#22269;&#21307;&#23398;&#31185;&#23398;&#38498;&#32959;&#30244;&#21307;&#38498;&#34892;LDCT&#32954;&#30284;&#31579;&#26597;&#30340;4 989&#20363;&#26080;&#30151;&#29366;&#21463;&#26816;&#32773;&#65292;&#20854;&#20013;&#30007;2 542&#20363;&#65292;&#22899;2 447&#20363;&#12290;&#20896;&#29366;&#21160;&#33033;&#38041;&#21270;&#35780;&#20215;&#37319;&#29992;&#35270;&#35273;&#35780;&#20998;&#27861;&#65292;&#37319;&#29992;&#967;(2)&#26816;&#39564;&#21450;&#29420;&#31435;&#26679;&#26412;t&#26816;&#39564;&#27604;&#36739;&#21508;&#32452;&#38388;CAC&#38451;&#24615;&#29575;&#30340;&#24046;&#24322;&#65292;&#24433;&#21709;&#22240;&#32032;&#20998;&#26512;&#37319;&#29992;logistic&#22810;&#22240;&#32032;&#22238;&#24402;&#20998;&#26512;&#12290; &#32467;&#26524;&#65306; 4 989&#20363;&#26080;&#30151;&#29366;&#21463;&#26816;&#32773;&#20013;&#26816;&#20986;CAC&#38451;&#24615;1 018&#20363;&#65292;&#38451;&#24615;&#29575;&#20026;20.4%&#65292;&#20854;&#20013;&#36731;&#24230;&#12289;&#20013;&#24230;&#21450;&#37325;&#24230;&#38041;&#21270;&#20998;&#21035;&#21344;86.3%(879\/1 018)&#12289;11.4%(116\/1 018)&#21450;2.3%(23\/1 018)&#12290;CAC&#38451;&#24615;&#32452;&#21644;CAC&#38452;&#24615;&#32452;&#21463;&#26816;&#32773;&#30340;&#24615;&#21035;&#12289;&#24180;&#40836;&#12289;&#20307;&#36136;&#25351;&#25968;&#12289;&#25945;&#32946;&#31243;&#24230;&#12289;&#32844;&#19994;&#31867;&#22411;&#12289;&#21560;&#28895;&#21490;&#12289;&#31958;&#23615;&#30149;&#12289;&#39640;&#34880;&#21387;&#12289;&#39640;&#34880;&#33026;&#30151;&#21644;&#34092;&#33756;&#21450;&#27700;&#26524;&#39135;&#29992;&#39057;&#29575;&#24046;&#24322;&#22343;&#26377;&#32479;&#35745;&#23398;&#24847;&#20041;(&#22343;P<0.05)&#12290;&#24615;&#21035;&#12289;&#24180;&#40836;&#12289;&#31958;&#23615;&#30149;&#12289;&#39640;&#34880;&#21387;&#12289;&#39640;&#34880;&#33026;&#30151;&#21644;&#21560;&#28895;&#21490;&#26159;CAC&#30340;&#29420;&#31435;&#21361;&#38505;&#22240;&#32032;(&#22343;P<0.05)&#65292;&#36731;&#24230;&#38041;&#21270;&#32452;&#19982;&#20013;&#24230;&#38041;&#21270;&#32452;&#21463;&#26816;&#32773;&#30340;&#24180;&#40836;&#12289;&#31958;&#23615;&#30149;&#12289;&#39640;&#34880;&#21387;&#21644;&#21560;&#28895;&#21490;&#24046;&#24322;&#26377;&#32479;&#35745;&#23398;&#24847;&#20041;(&#22343;P<0.05)&#12290;1 018&#20363;CAC&#38451;&#24615;&#32773;&#20013;&#20849;&#26377;1 730&#25903;&#20896;&#29366;&#21160;&#33033;&#23384;&#22312;&#38041;&#21270;&#65292;&#20854;&#20013;&#24038;&#21069;&#38477;&#25903;&#38041;&#21270;&#21457;&#29983;&#29575;&#26368;&#39640;(51.3%&#65292;888\/1 730)&#65292;568&#20363;(55.8%&#65292;568\/1 018)&#20026;&#21333;&#25903;&#38041;&#21270;&#65292;450&#20363;(44.2%&#65292;450\/1 018)&#20026;&#22810;&#25903;&#38041;&#21270;&#12290; &#32467;&#35770;&#65306; LDCT&#22312;&#36827;&#34892;&#32954;&#30284;&#31579;&#26597;&#30340;&#21516;&#26102;&#21487;&#28385;&#36275;CAC&#19968;&#31449;&#24335;&#26089;&#35786;&#26089;&#31579;&#30340;&#38656;&#27714;&#65292;&#24615;&#21035;&#12289;&#24180;&#40836;&#12289;&#31958;&#23615;&#30149;&#12289;&#39640;&#34880;&#21387;&#12289;&#39640;&#34880;&#33026;&#30151;&#21450;&#21560;&#28895;&#21490;&#19982;CAC&#26377;&#20851;&#12290;.","query":"cancer"},"36319456":{"ArticleTitle":"[Expression and regulatory role of ultraconserved long non-coding RNA uc.77 in lung cancer].","AbstractText":"Objective: To investigate the effect and molecular mechanism of ultra-conservative long non-coding RNA uc.77 in lung cancer. Methods: Lung cancer tissues and adjacent normal tissues were obtained from 61 patients with lung cancer who were diagnosed with lung cancer and underwent surgery from 2014 to 2016 in the General Hospital of the Southern Theater Command of the People's Liberation Army. Real-time fluorescence quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to detect the uc.77 relative expressions in normal human bronchial epithelial cells 16HBE, lung cancer cell lines, and 61 pair lung cancer tissues. Uc.77 siRNA was transfected into lung cancer cells to interfere with the expression of uc.77, qRT-PCR was used to verify the interference effect, CCK8 method and clone formation experiment were used to detect cell proliferation ability, flow cytometry was used to detect apoptosis and cell cycle changes. H1299 cells transfected with uc.77 siRNA were injected into the subcutaneous right side of BALB\/c nude mice to construct a tumor-bearing model for exploring the role of uc.77 on tumor growth. Western blot and qRT-PCR methods were used to detect the protein and mRNA expressions of p21. Results: The relative expression levels of uc.77 in lung cancer cell lines 95D, H1299, A549, H460, H446 and 16HBE-T were significantly higher than that of 16HBE cells (P<0.05). The uc.77 RNA expression levels of lung cancer tissues was significantly higher than that of the adjacent normal tissues (P<0.001). In addition, increased lncRNA uc.77 expression was significantly associated with big tumor size, lymph node metastasis and advanced TNM stage (P<0.05). After transfection with uc.77 siRNA, the expressions of uc.77 in H1299, 95-D and 16HBE-T cells were reduced (P<0.05), and the cell proliferation capacities were reduced at 48 hours and 72 hours (P<0.05). After transfection with uc.77 siRNA-1, the G(0)\/G(1) phase cell ratio of H1299 siRNA-1 group [(71.86&#177;3.46)%] was higher than those of H1299-control group [(47.62&#177;5.48)%] and H1299 siRNA-NC group [(61.38&#177;5.62)%, P<0.05], S phase cell ratio of H1299 siRNA-1 group [(14.99&#177;3.61)%] was lower than those of H1299-control group [(34.95&#177;7.05)%] and H1299 siRNA-NC group [(23.75&#177;5.87)%, P<0.05], the apoptosis rate of H1299 siRNA-1 group [(4.90&#177;1.80)%] was higher than those of H1299-control group [(3.30&#177;0.80)%] and H1299 siRNA-NC group [(2.80&#177;1.20)%, P<0.05], the colony formation rate of H1299 siRNA-1 group [(19.20&#177;2.00)%] was lower than those of H1299 control group [(32.60&#177;2.00)%] and H1299 siRNA-NC group [(34.40&#177;1.00)%, P<0.05]. The results of the nude mice tumor formation experiment showed that the tumor volume of the H1299 siRNA-1 group was significantly lower than those of the H1299-control group and the H1299-negative control group (P<0.05), the average tumor weight of H1299 siRNA-1 group was significantly lower than those of H1299-control group and H1299-negative control group (P<0.05), tumor cell growth marker Ki-67 in the H1299 siRNA-1 group showed weak positive, and Ki-67 in the H1299-control group and H1299-negative control group showed positive. The result of qRT-PCR analysis showed that the mRNA expression level of p21 in H1299 siRNA-1 group (2.57&#177;0.45) was higher than those in H1299 control group (1.00&#177;0.00, P=0.001) and H1299 siRNA-NC group (1.52&#177;0.37, P=0.009). The result of western blotting analysis also showed that the expression of p21 protein level in H1299 siRNA-1 group increased. Conclusions: The expression of ultraconserved long non-coding RNA uc.77 is elevated in lung cancer cell lines and lung cancer tissues. Silencing the expression of ultraconservative long noncoding RNA uc.77 can inhibit tumor growth, and blocking uc.77 expression may be a potential therapeutic target for lung cancer. &#30446;&#30340;&#65306;&#25506;&#35752;&#36229;&#20445;&#23432;&#38271;&#38142;&#38750;&#32534;&#30721;RNA uc.77(uc.77)&#22312;&#32954;&#30284;&#20013;&#30340;&#34920;&#36798;&#21450;&#20854;&#20998;&#23376;&#26426;&#21046;&#12290;

Methods: The cancer registry data were collected and analyzed on mortality of oesophagus cancer during 1972-2016 in Qidong in different sex, age and time. Indices of statistics included crude mortality rate (CR), China age-standardized rate (CASR), world age-standardized rate (WASR), 35-64 years truncated rate, 0-74 years cumulative rate, cumulative risk, average annual percentage change (AAPC), mortality by period and mortality in the birth cohort. Results: A total of 4 795 esophageal cancer cases (male: 3 315, female: 1 480) died during the 45 years, accounting for 4.85% of all cancer deaths. The crude mortality was 9.48\/10(5) (CASR: 3.62\/10(5,) WASR: 6.30\/10(5)) from 1972 to 2016. The crude mortality was significantly increased with age. In 2016, the crude mortality was 11.61\/10(5) (CASR: 2.64\/10(5,) WASR: 4.89\/10(5)), respectively. The average annual percentage change (AAPC) were 0.99%&#12289;-2.03%&#12289;-1.72%. The mortalities of esophageal cancer in all age groups from 35 to 74 have been decreasing since the 1980s. The age-birth cohort analysis showed a decline in mortality rates in age groups from 40 to 79. Conclusions: The crude mortality rate of esophageal cancer increases slightly in Qidong, while the China age-standardized rate and world age-standardized rate decrease significantly. However, esophageal cancer is still one of the malignant tumors that affects the health of residents and seriously threatens the people's lives and health. The situation of cancer prevention and control is still serious in Qidong. &#30446;&#30340;&#65306;&#20998;&#26512;&#27743;&#33487;&#30465;&#21551;&#19996;&#24066;1972&#8212;2016&#24180;&#39135;&#31649;&#30284;&#27515;&#20129;&#27969;&#34892;&#29305;&#24449;&#65292;&#20026;&#21046;&#23450;&#39135;&#31649;&#30284;&#38450;&#25511;&#25514;&#26045;&#19982;&#31574;&#30053;&#25552;&#20379;&#20381;&#25454;&#12290; &#26041;&#27861;&#65306;&#26681;&#25454;&#21551;&#19996;&#24066;1972&#8212;2016&#24180;&#30284;&#30151;&#27515;&#20129;&#30331;&#35760;&#25968;&#25454;&#24211;&#21450;&#21382;&#24180;&#20154;&#21475;&#36164;&#26009;&#65292;&#35745;&#31639;&#31895;&#27515;&#20129;&#29575;&#12289;&#20013;&#26631;&#29575;&#12289;&#19990;&#26631;&#29575;&#12289;35~64&#23681;&#25130;&#32553;&#29575;&#12289;0~74&#23681;&#32047;&#31215;&#29575;&#12289;&#32047;&#31215;&#39118;&#38505;&#12289;&#27515;&#20129;&#29575;&#24180;&#22343;&#21464;&#21270;&#30334;&#20998;&#27604;(AAPC)&#12289;&#21508;&#26102;&#26399;&#27515;&#20129;&#29575;&#21450;&#20986;&#29983;&#38431;&#21015;&#27515;&#20129;&#29575;&#12290; &#32467;&#26524;&#65306; 1972&#8212;2016&#24180;&#21551;&#19996;&#24066;&#39135;&#31649;&#30284;&#27515;&#20129;4 795&#20363;&#65292;&#30007;3 315&#20363;&#65292;&#22899;1 480&#20363;&#65292;&#21344;&#20840;&#37096;&#24694;&#24615;&#32959;&#30244;&#27515;&#20129;&#30340;4.85%&#12290;&#39135;&#31649;&#30284;&#31895;&#27515;&#20129;&#29575;&#20026;9.48\/10&#19975;&#65292;&#20013;&#26631;&#29575;3.62\/10&#19975;&#65292;&#19990;&#26631;&#29575;6.30\/10&#19975;&#65292;&#31895;&#27515;&#20129;&#29575;&#38543;&#24180;&#40836;&#30340;&#22686;&#38271;&#32780;&#21319;&#39640;&#12290;2016&#24180;&#39135;&#31649;&#30284;&#31895;&#27515;&#20129;&#29575;&#20026;11.61\/10&#19975;&#65292;&#20013;&#26631;&#29575;2.64\/10&#19975;&#65292;&#19990;&#26631;&#29575;4.89\/10&#19975;&#12290;1972&#8212;2016&#24180;&#39135;&#31649;&#30284;&#31895;&#27515;&#20129;&#29575;&#12289;&#20013;&#26631;&#29575;&#12289;&#19990;&#26631;&#29575;&#30340;AAPC&#20998;&#21035;&#20026;0.99%&#12289;&#65293;2.03%&#12289;&#65293;1.72%&#12290;35~74&#23681;&#21508;&#24180;&#40836;&#32452;&#39135;&#31649;&#30284;&#27515;&#20129;&#29575;&#33258;20&#19990;&#32426;80&#24180;&#20195;&#36215;&#22343;&#21576;&#19979;&#38477;&#36235;&#21183;&#12290;&#24180;&#40836;&#65293;&#20986;&#29983;&#38431;&#21015;&#20998;&#26512;&#32467;&#26524;&#20063;&#26174;&#31034;&#65292;40~79&#23681;&#21508;&#24180;&#40836;&#32452;&#27515;&#20129;&#29575;&#22343;&#26377;&#19979;&#38477;&#12290; &#32467;&#35770;&#65306;&#21551;&#19996;&#24066;&#39135;&#31649;&#30284;&#31895;&#27515;&#20129;&#29575;&#30053;&#26377;&#19978;&#21319;&#65292;&#20013;&#26631;&#29575;&#12289;&#19990;&#26631;&#29575;&#19979;&#38477;&#36235;&#21183;&#26126;&#26174;&#65292;&#20294;&#20173;&#26159;&#24433;&#21709;&#23621;&#27665;&#20581;&#24247;&#30340;&#20027;&#35201;&#24694;&#24615;&#32959;&#30244;&#20043;&#19968;&#65292;&#20005;&#37325;&#23041;&#32961;&#20154;&#27665;&#32676;&#20247;&#29983;&#21629;&#20581;&#24247;&#65292;&#38450;&#25511;&#24418;&#21183;&#20381;&#28982;&#20005;&#23803;&#12290;.","query":"cancer"},"36319454":{"ArticleTitle":"[Long-term trend of esophageal cancer survival rate in Qidong, 1972-2016].","AbstractText":"Objective: To analyze the survival of esophageal cancer cases in Qidong, Jiangsu Province from 1972 to 2016, and provide a basis for the prognosis evaluation and prevention of esophageal cancer patients. Methods: The data of esophageal cancer were obtained from the Qidong Cancer Registration and Reporting System, and the follow-up date ended December 31, 2021. Observed survival rate (OSR) and relative survival rate (RSR) were calculated by SURV 3.01 software, and Hakulinen's likelihood ratio test was used for statistical difference comparison. Joinpoint regression model was used to conduct the average annual percentage change (AAPC) in esophageal cancer survival rate, and the ARIMA model was used to predict the trend of esophageal cancer survival rate. Results: During 1972 to 2016, there were 5 112 new cases of esophageal cancer in Qidong. The OSR of esophageal cancer at 1, 5 and 10 years were 24.43%, 6.93% and 4.43%, and the RSR at 1, 5 and 10 years were 25.88%, 9.35% and 8.34%, respectively. Dividing 1972-2016 into 9 periods, compared with 1972-1976, the 5-year RSR from 2012-2016 increased from 4.47% to 17.85%, and the RSR trend of the 9 periods was statistically significant (&#967;(2)=263.43, P<0.001). The survival rate of female with esophageal cancer was slightly higher than that of male, however, there was no significant difference in RSR between male and female (&#967;(2)=9.40, P=0.401). The 5-OSR and 5-RSR for male were 6.73% and 9.11%, and for female were 7.37% and 9.87%, respectively. The 5-RSR for the age groups of 45-54, 55-64, 65-74, and over 75 years old were 11.99%, 11.21%, 8.17% and 7.08%, respectively. There was a statistically significant difference in RSR among different age groups (&#967;(2)=98.19, P<0.001). The time trend results showed that the overall AAPC of the 5-RSR of esophageal cancer in Qidong from 1972 to 2016 was 3.89% (t=11.98, P<0.001). The 5-RSR uptrend was consistent among different genders, and the uptrend was greater in female (AAPC=4.25% for male, and AAPC=5.72% for female, P<0.05). Furthermore, the 5-RSR of esophageal cancer in all age groups showed an upward trend, and the upward trend was statistically significant in the 55-64-year-old group (AAPC=4.23%, P<0.05) and the 65-74-year-old group (AAPC=6.82%, P<0.05), there was no statistical significance in the 45-54-year-old group (AAPC=2.17%, P>0.05) and more than 75 years old group (AAPC=1.82%, P>0.05). Survival rate prediction of esophageal cancer showed that by 2026, 5-RSR will increase to 24.79%. Conclusions: During 1972 to 2016, the overall survival rate of esophageal cancer in the whole population of Qidong has improved to a certain extent, but there is still a large room for improvement. More emphasis should be continued to strengthen on the early diagnosis and early treatment of esophageal cancer. &#30446;&#30340;&#65306;&#20998;&#26512;1972&#8212;2016&#24180;&#27743;&#33487;&#30465;&#21551;&#19996;&#24066;&#39135;&#31649;&#30284;&#24739;&#32773;&#30340;&#29983;&#23384;&#24773;&#20917;&#65292;&#20026;&#39135;&#31649;&#30284;&#24739;&#32773;&#39044;&#21518;&#35780;&#20215;&#21644;&#21046;&#23450;&#38450;&#25511;&#25514;&#26045;&#25552;&#20379;&#20381;&#25454;&#12290; &#26041;&#27861;&#65306;&#39135;&#31649;&#30284;&#36164;&#26009;&#26469;&#28304;&#20110;&#21551;&#19996;&#24066;&#32959;&#30244;&#30331;&#35760;&#25253;&#21578;&#31995;&#32479;&#65292;&#38543;&#35775;&#25130;&#33267;2021&#24180;12&#26376;31&#26085;&#12290;&#37319;&#29992;SURV 3.01&#36719;&#20214;&#35745;&#31639;&#35266;&#23519;&#29983;&#23384;&#29575;(OSR)&#21644;&#30456;&#23545;&#29983;&#23384;&#29575;(RSR)&#65292;Hakulinen&#27663;&#20284;&#28982;&#27604;&#26816;&#39564;&#27861;&#36827;&#34892;&#36235;&#21183;&#26816;&#39564;&#12290;&#37319;&#29992;Joinpoint&#22238;&#24402;&#27169;&#22411;&#35745;&#31639;&#29983;&#23384;&#29575;&#24179;&#22343;&#24180;&#24230;&#21464;&#21270;&#30334;&#20998;&#27604;(AAPC)&#65292;&#37319;&#29992;ARIMA&#27169;&#22411;&#36827;&#34892;&#39135;&#31649;&#30284;&#29983;&#23384;&#29575;&#36235;&#21183;&#39044;&#27979;&#12290; &#32467;&#26524;&#65306; 1972&#8212;2016&#24180;&#21551;&#19996;&#24066;&#39135;&#31649;&#30284;&#26032;&#21457;&#30149;&#20363;&#20849;5 112&#20363;&#65292;&#39135;&#31649;&#30284;1&#12289;5&#12289;10&#24180;OSR&#20998;&#21035;&#20026;24.43%&#12289;6.93%&#21644;4.43%&#65292;1&#12289;5&#12289;10&#24180;RSR&#20998;&#21035;&#20026;25.88%&#12289;9.35%&#21644;8.34%&#12290;&#23558;1972&#8212;2016&#24180;&#20998;&#20026;9&#20010;&#26102;&#26399;&#65292;&#19982;1972&#8212;1976&#24180;&#30456;&#27604;&#65292;2012&#8212;2016&#24180;&#30340;5&#24180;RSR&#20174;4.47%&#19978;&#21319;&#33267;17.85%&#65292;9&#20010;&#26102;&#26399;&#30340;RSR&#19978;&#21319;&#36235;&#21183;&#26377;&#32479;&#35745;&#23398;&#24847;&#20041;(&#967;(2)&#65309;263.43&#65292;P<0.001)&#12290;&#22899;&#24615;&#39135;&#31649;&#30284;&#29983;&#23384;&#29575;&#30053;&#39640;&#20110;&#30007;&#24615;&#65292;&#30007;&#22899;RSR&#24046;&#24322;&#26080;&#32479;&#35745;&#23398;&#24847;&#20041;(&#967;(2)&#65309;9.40&#65292;P&#65309;0.401)&#65292;&#30007;&#24615;5&#24180;OSR&#20026;6.73%&#65292;&#22899;&#24615;7.37%&#65307;&#30007;&#24615;5&#24180;RSR&#20026;9.11%&#65292;&#22899;&#24615;9.87%&#12290;45~54&#23681;&#12289;55~64&#23681;&#12289;65~74&#23681;&#21644;&#8805;75&#23681;&#24180;&#40836;&#32452;&#30340;5&#24180;RSR&#20998;&#21035;&#20026;11.99%&#12289;11.21%&#12289;8.17%&#21644;7.08%&#65292;&#21508;&#24180;&#40836;&#32452;&#20043;&#38388;RSR&#24046;&#24322;&#26377;&#32479;&#35745;&#23398;&#24847;&#20041;(&#967;(2)&#65309;98.19&#65292;P<0.001)&#12290;&#26102;&#38388;&#36235;&#21183;&#32467;&#26524;&#26174;&#31034;&#65292;1972&#8212;2016&#24180;&#21551;&#19996;&#24066;&#39135;&#31649;&#30284;5&#24180;RSR&#24635;&#20307;AAPC&#20026;3.89%(t&#65309;11.98&#65292;P<0.001)&#65292;&#19981;&#21516;&#24615;&#21035;5&#24180;RSR&#19978;&#21319;&#36235;&#21183;&#19968;&#33268;&#65292;&#22899;&#24615;&#25552;&#21319;&#26356;&#22823;(&#30007;&#24615;AAPC&#65309;4.25%&#65292;&#22899;&#24615;AAPC&#65309;5.72%&#65292;&#22343;P<0.05)&#12290;&#21508;&#24180;&#40836;&#32452;&#39135;&#31649;&#30284;5&#24180;RSR&#22343;&#21576;&#19978;&#21319;&#36235;&#21183;&#65292;55~64&#23681;&#32452;(AAPC&#65309;4.23%)&#21644;65~74&#23681;&#32452;(AAPC&#65309;6.82%)&#19978;&#21319;&#36235;&#21183;&#26377;&#32479;&#35745;&#23398;&#24847;&#20041;(&#22343;P<0.05)&#65307;45~54&#23681;&#32452;(AAPC&#65309;2.17%)&#21644;&#8805;75&#23681;&#32452;(AAPC&#65309;1.82%)&#26080;&#32479;&#35745;&#23398;&#24847;&#20041;(&#22343;P>0.05)&#12290;&#39135;&#31649;&#30284;&#29983;&#23384;&#29575;&#39044;&#27979;&#32467;&#26524;&#26174;&#31034;&#65292;2026&#24180;&#21551;&#19996;&#24066;&#39135;&#31649;&#30284;5&#24180;RSR&#23558;&#19978;&#21319;&#33267;24.79%&#12290; &#32467;&#35770;&#65306; 1972&#8212;2016&#24180;&#21551;&#19996;&#24066;&#20840;&#20154;&#32676;&#39135;&#31649;&#30284;&#24635;&#20307;&#29983;&#23384;&#29575;&#26377;&#20102;&#19968;&#23450;&#30340;&#25552;&#39640;&#65292;&#20294;&#20173;&#26377;&#36739;&#22823;&#19978;&#21319;&#31354;&#38388;&#65292;&#24212;&#24403;&#32487;&#32493;&#21152;&#24378;&#37325;&#35270;&#39135;&#31649;&#30284;&#26089;&#35786;&#26089;&#27835;&#12290;.","query":"cancer"},"36319453":{"ArticleTitle":"[Chinse expert consensus on issues related to the protection, treatment and management of patients with solid tumors during COVID-19 (2022 edition)].","AbstractText":"The new coronavirus is still in the global pandemic stage.

In recent years, the five-year survival of esophageal cancer in China has improved significantly. However, due to the absence of typical symptoms in early stage, there still exists a large esophageal cancer diagnostic yield gap between China and developed countries. At present, there are no international guidelines defining the target population for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) screening. Exploring and implementing effective esophageal cancer screening together with early diagnosis and early treatment are the keys to reducing the mortality and improving the survival rate and life quality. Endoscopic therapies, such as endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD), endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR), and radiofrequency ablation (RFA), are used to treat early-stage esophageal cancer. If the tumor invasion is deep or lymph node metastasis is suspected, surgery is needed, meanwhile radiation therapy could also be an optional treatment. Regular follow-up and surveillance are required for any strategy above to deal with relapse and metachronous primary cancers. The Early Diagnosis and Treatment Group of the Chinese Medical Association Oncology Branch has reached an expert consensus on screening and diagnostic protocols for esophageal cancer, on endoscopic and surgical treatment of early esophageal cancer and precancerous lesions, as well as on postoperative monitoring and adjuvant therapy. This consensus follows the evidence-based medicine at both domestic and international levels, combines the current clinical practice and application experience in the treatment of esophageal cancer in China, is based on a multidisciplinary treatment model, and can be used as a reference for clinicians. &#20013;&#22269;&#39135;&#31649;&#30284;&#21457;&#30149;&#29575;&#26377;&#19979;&#38477;&#36235;&#21183;&#65292;&#20294;&#20013;&#22269;&#20173;&#26159;&#39135;&#31649;&#30284;&#39640;&#21457;&#22269;&#23478;&#65292;&#19988;&#39135;&#31649;&#30284;&#21457;&#30149;&#26377;&#26126;&#26174;&#30340;&#22320;&#21306;&#24046;&#24322;&#12290;&#36817;&#24180;&#26469;&#65292;&#20013;&#22269;&#39135;&#31649;&#30284;&#30340;5&#24180;&#29983;&#23384;&#29575;&#26377;&#26126;&#26174;&#25552;&#39640;&#65292;&#20294;&#22240;&#26089;&#26399;&#39135;&#31649;&#30284;&#32570;&#20047;&#20856;&#22411;&#30340;&#20020;&#24202;&#30151;&#29366;&#65292;&#26089;&#26399;&#21457;&#29616;&#29575;&#20559;&#20302;&#65292;&#19982;&#21457;&#36798;&#22269;&#23478;&#30456;&#27604;&#36824;&#26377;&#36739;&#22823;&#24046;&#36317;&#12290;&#30446;&#21069;&#22269;&#22806;&#23578;&#26080;&#25351;&#21335;&#23545;&#39135;&#31649;&#40158;&#29366;&#32454;&#32990;&#30284;&#31579;&#26597;&#30446;&#26631;&#20154;&#32676;&#36827;&#34892;&#30028;&#23450;&#65292;&#23547;&#25214;&#21644;&#23454;&#26045;&#26377;&#25928;&#30340;&#31579;&#26597;&#26041;&#26696;&#21644;&#26089;&#35786;&#26089;&#27835;&#26159;&#38477;&#20302;&#39135;&#31649;&#30284;&#27515;&#20129;&#29575;&#12289;&#25552;&#39640;&#29983;&#23384;&#29575;&#21644;&#29983;&#23384;&#36136;&#37327;&#30340;&#20851;&#38190;&#25163;&#27573;&#12290;&#26089;&#26399;&#39135;&#31649;&#30284;&#30340;&#27835;&#30103;&#25514;&#26045;&#20026;&#20869;&#38236;&#27835;&#30103;&#65292;&#21253;&#25324;&#20869;&#38236;&#40655;&#33180;&#19979;&#21093;&#31163;&#26415;&#12289;&#20869;&#38236;&#19979;&#40655;&#33180;&#20999;&#38500;&#26415;&#12289;&#20869;&#38236;&#19979;&#23556;&#39057;&#28040;&#34701;&#26415;&#31561;&#65292;&#33509;&#32959;&#30244;&#20405;&#29359;&#31243;&#24230;&#36739;&#28145;&#25110;&#24576;&#30097;&#26377;&#28107;&#24052;&#32467;&#36716;&#31227;&#65292;&#38656;&#37319;&#21462;&#25163;&#26415;&#27835;&#30103;&#65292;&#21516;&#26102;&#25918;&#23556;&#27835;&#30103;&#20063;&#21487;&#20316;&#20026;&#19968;&#31181;&#21487;&#36873;&#25321;&#30340;&#27835;&#30103;&#26041;&#24335;&#12290;&#26080;&#35770;&#21738;&#31181;&#26041;&#24335;&#30340;&#27835;&#30103;&#65292;&#22343;&#38656;&#35268;&#24459;&#38543;&#35775;&#21644;&#30417;&#27979;&#65292;&#31215;&#26497;&#22788;&#29702;&#22797;&#21457;&#24615;&#30149;&#21464;&#21644;&#24322;&#26102;&#24615;&#26032;&#21457;&#32959;&#30244;&#12290;&#20013;&#21326;&#21307;&#23398;&#20250;&#32959;&#30244;&#23398;&#20998;&#20250;&#26089;&#35786;&#26089;&#27835;&#23398;&#32452;&#26681;&#25454;&#22269;&#20869;&#22806;&#24490;&#35777;&#21307;&#23398;&#20381;&#25454;&#65292;&#32467;&#21512;&#30446;&#21069;&#20013;&#22269;&#39135;&#31649;&#30284;&#27835;&#30103;&#30340;&#20020;&#24202;&#23454;&#36341;&#19982;&#24212;&#29992;&#32463;&#39564;&#65292;&#20197;&#22810;&#23398;&#31185;&#35786;&#30103;&#27169;&#24335;&#20026;&#22522;&#30784;&#65292;&#23601;&#39135;&#31649;&#30284;&#30340;&#31579;&#26597;&#21644;&#35786;&#26029;&#26041;&#26696;&#12289;&#26089;&#26399;&#39135;&#31649;&#30284;&#21450;&#30284;&#21069;&#30149;&#21464;&#30340;&#20869;&#38236;&#21644;&#22806;&#31185;&#22788;&#29702;&#20197;&#21450;&#26415;&#21518;&#30417;&#27979;&#21644;&#36741;&#21161;&#27835;&#30103;&#31561;&#36798;&#25104;&#19987;&#23478;&#20849;&#35782;&#65292;&#20379;&#20020;&#24202;&#21307;&#24072;&#21442;&#32771;&#12290;.","query":"cancer"},"36319450":{"ArticleTitle":"[Chinese expert consensus on immunotherapy for advanced non-small lung cancer with oncogenic driver mutations (2022 edition)].","AbstractText":"Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with oncogenic driver mutations was previously deemed \" forbidden territory\" for immunotherapy.

According to the structural characteristics, antibody-based drugs currently on the market can be divided into several categories, including monoclonal antibody drugs, bispecific antibody drugs and antibody drug conjugates. Until June 1, 2022, 39 anti-tumor antibody drugs have been approved in China. Since the pharmaceutical characteristics, in vivo efficacy and pharmacokinetic characteristics of anti-tumor antibody drugs are different from those of traditional small molecule drugs, the pharmaceutical care of anti-tumor antibody drugs in clinical application has distinct features. To regulate pharmaceutical care of these drugs, promote the rational use of antibody drugs in China, this guideline has been made by Cancer Pharmacists Branch of Chinese Pharmacists Association, with the guidance of the National Cancer Center. We used the Delphi method and expert interview and discussion, to build the key problems. The contents in this guideline are based on clinical evidence, domestic pharmaceutical management regulations and pharmaceutical care practice. This guideline covers the whole process of pharmaceutical care system, includes the using of before, during and after drug administration.

To address this, a method for the preparation of magnetic nanoparticles with ultrahigh heating capacity in the presence of an alternating magnetic field (AMF) is presented. The low nitrogen flow rate of 10&#160;mL min-1 during the thermal decomposition reaction results in cobalt-doped nanoparticles with a magnetite (Fe3 O4 ) core and a maghemite (&#947;-Fe2 O3 ) shell that exhibit the highest intrinsic loss power reported to date of 47.5 nH m2 kg-1 . The heating efficiency of these nanoparticles correlates positively with increasing shell thickness, which can be controlled by the flow rate of nitrogen. Intravenous injection of nanoparticles at a low dose of 4&#160;mg kg-1 elevates intratumoral temperatures to 50&#160;&#176;C in mice-bearing subcutaneous and metastatic cancer grafts during exposure to AMF. This approach can also be applied to the synthesis of other metal-doped nanoparticles with core-shell structures. Consequently, this method can potentially be used for the development of novel nanoparticles with high heating performance, further advancing systemic magnetic hyperthermia for cancer treatment.","query":"cancer"},"36319186":{"ArticleTitle":"Irradiation accelerates SARS-CoV-2 infection by enhancing sphingolipid metabolism.","AbstractText":"Cancer patients who receive radiotherapy have a high risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, but the concrete reason remains unclear. Herein, we investigated the influence of irradiation on the vulnerability of cancer cells to SARS-CoV-2 using S pseudovirions and probed the underlying mechanism via RNA-seq and other molecular biology techniques. Owing to the enhancement of sphingolipid metabolism, irradiation accelerated pseudovirion infection. Mechanistically, irradiation induced the expression of acid sphingomyelinase (ASM), which catalyses the hydrolysis of sphingomyelin to ceramide, contributing to lipid raft formation and promoting SARS-CoV-2 invasion. Inhibition of lipid raft formation with methyl-&#946;-cyclodextrin (M&#946;CD) or the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein and ASM suppression through small interfering RNA or amitriptyline (AMT) treatment abolished the enhancing effect of irradiation on viral infection. Animal experiments supported the finding that irradiation promoted SARS-CoV-2 S pseudovirion infection in A549 cell tumour-bearing BALB\/c nude mice, whereas AMT treatment dramatically decreased viral infection. This study discloses the role of sphingolipid metabolism in irradiation-induced SARS-CoV-2 infection, thus providing a potential target for clinical intervention to protect patients receiving radiotherapy from COVID-19.

Methods: Data of clinical characteristics and treatment outcomes of patients with HL diagnosed in Cancer Hospital Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences (CHCAMS) from January 1st, 2000 to December 31st, 2018 who received standard first-line treatment were retrospectively analyzed and compared with that of HL patients who received treatment in the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database in the United States during the same period. Factors associated with freedom from progression (FFP) of patients in CHCAMS were analyzed. Treatment and survival data of patients with relapsed\/refractory HL (r\/rHL) who had failed the standard first-line treatment during the corresponding period in CHCAMS were collected to analyze the outcomes of salvage therapy. Results: A total of 764 HL patients in CHCAMS were included in this study. The median age was 30 years (range, 14-83 years), with 424 males and 340 females. By February 26th, 2022, the patients were followed-up for a median time of 111 months(range, 0.3-262.0 months). Lymphoma-specific survival (LSS) rate and overall survival (OS) rate at 10 years for HL patients in CHCAMS was 91.7% (95%CI: 89.5%-93.9%) and 87.1% (95%CI: 84.5%-89.8%), respectively. LSS and OS rate at 10 years for HL patients from SEER database was 86.8% (95%CI: 86.3%-87.2%) and 79.0% (95%CI: 78.5%-79.5%), respectively. The unadjusted LSS and OS rate for patients in CHCAMS were higher than those for patients from SEER database (both P<0.001). No significant difference was observed in LSS and OS rate (both P>0.05) between the two groups after adjustment. European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer staging system (early-stage unfavorable: HR=2.35, 95%CI: 1.13-4.89, P=0.023; advanced stage: HR=5.44, 95%CI: 2.62-11.30, P<0.001) and serum &#946;2 microglobulin (HR=1.67, 95%CI: 1.08-2.58, P=0.021) were influencing factors of FFP for patients in CHCAMS. The complete remission rate, median progression-free survival (PFS), 5-year PFS rate and 5-year OS rate for the 116 patients with r\/rHL was 37.9% (95%CI: 29.6%-47.0%), 15.0 months (95%CI: 9.9-20.1 months), 29.9% (95%CI: 20.9%-38.9%) and 62.9% (95%CI: 54.1%-71.7%), respectively. Conclusions: The outcomes of HL patients receiving standard first-line treatment are excellent. However, the therapeutic effect of HL patients who incurrs disease progression or relapse after standard first-line treatment is not satisfying. &#30446;&#30340;&#65306; &#20998;&#26512;&#25509;&#21463;&#26631;&#20934;&#19968;&#32447;&#27835;&#30103;&#30340;&#38669;&#22855;&#37329;&#28107;&#24052;&#30244;&#65288;HL&#65289;&#24739;&#32773;&#30340;&#29983;&#23384;&#21644;&#39044;&#21518;&#24773;&#20917;&#12290; &#26041;&#27861;&#65306; &#22238;&#39038;&#24615;&#20998;&#26512;2000&#24180;1&#26376;1 &#26085;&#33267;2018&#24180;12&#26376;31&#26085;&#22312;&#20013;&#22269;&#21307;&#23398;&#31185;&#23398;&#38498;&#32959;&#30244;&#21307;&#38498;&#25509;&#21463;&#26631;&#20934;&#19968;&#32447;&#27835;&#30103;&#30340;HL&#24739;&#32773;&#30340;&#27835;&#30103;&#25928;&#26524;&#65292;&#19982;&#21516;&#26399;&#32654;&#22269;&#30417;&#27979;&#12289;&#27969;&#34892;&#30149;&#23398;&#21644;&#26368;&#32456;&#32467;&#26524;&#65288;SEER&#65289;&#25968;&#25454;&#24211;&#25509;&#21463;&#27835;&#30103;&#30340;HL&#24739;&#32773;&#29983;&#23384;&#24773;&#20917;&#36827;&#34892;&#23545;&#27604;&#12290;&#20998;&#26512;&#24433;&#21709;HL&#24739;&#32773;&#26080;&#32959;&#30244;&#36827;&#23637;&#29983;&#23384;&#65288;FFP&#65289;&#30340;&#22240;&#32032;&#12290;&#25910;&#38598;&#21516;&#26399;&#22312;&#20013;&#22269;&#21307;&#23398;&#31185;&#23398;&#38498;&#32959;&#30244;&#21307;&#38498;&#25509;&#21463;&#26631;&#20934;&#19968;&#32447;&#27835;&#30103;&#30340;&#22797;&#21457;\/&#38590;&#27835;HL&#65288;r\/rHL&#65289;&#24739;&#32773;&#30340;&#27835;&#30103;&#21450;&#29983;&#23384;&#25968;&#25454;&#65292;&#20998;&#26512;&#35299;&#25937;&#27835;&#30103;&#30340;&#25928;&#26524;&#12290; &#32467;&#26524;&#65306; &#20849;&#32435;&#20837;&#20013;&#22269;&#21307;&#23398;&#31185;&#23398;&#38498;&#32959;&#30244;&#21307;&#38498;764&#20363;HL&#24739;&#32773;&#65292;&#20854;&#20013;&#30007;424&#20363;&#65292;&#22899;340&#20363;&#65292;&#20013;&#20301;&#24180;&#40836;30&#23681;&#65288;14~83&#23681;&#65289;&#12290;&#25130;&#33267;2022&#24180;2&#26376;26&#26085;&#65292;&#20013;&#20301;&#38543;&#35775;111&#20010;&#26376;&#65288;0.3~262.0&#20010;&#26376;&#65289;&#65292;10&#24180;&#28107;&#24052;&#30244;&#29305;&#24322;&#24615;&#29983;&#23384;&#65288;LSS&#65289;&#29575;&#21644;&#24635;&#29983;&#23384;&#65288;OS&#65289;&#29575;&#20998;&#21035;&#20026;91.7%&#65288;95%CI&#65306;89.5%~93.9%&#65289;&#21644;87.1%&#65288;95%CI&#65306;84.5%~89.8%&#65289;&#12290;SEER&#25968;&#25454;&#24211;&#20013;HL&#24739;&#32773;10&#24180;LSS&#29575;&#21644;OS&#29575;&#20998;&#21035;&#20026;86.8%&#65288;95%CI&#65306;86.3%~87.2%&#65289;&#21644;79.0%&#65288;95%CI&#65306;78.5%~79.5%&#65289;&#12290;&#26657;&#27491;&#21069;&#20013;&#22269;&#21307;&#23398;&#31185;&#23398;&#38498;&#32959;&#30244;&#21307;&#38498;HL&#24739;&#32773;10&#24180;LSS&#29575;&#21450;OS&#29575;&#22343;&#39640;&#20110;SEER&#25968;&#25454;&#24211;&#30340;&#24739;&#32773;&#65288;&#22343;P<0.001&#65289;&#65292;&#26657;&#27491;&#21518;&#20004;&#32452;10&#24180;LSS&#29575;&#21450;OS&#29575;&#24046;&#24322;&#22343;&#26080;&#32479;&#35745;&#23398;&#24847;&#20041;&#65288;&#22343;P>0.05&#65289;&#12290;&#27431;&#27954;&#30284;&#30151;&#27835;&#30103;&#30740;&#31350;&#32452;&#32455;&#20998;&#26399;&#65288;&#26089;&#26399;&#39044;&#21518;&#19981;&#33391;&#22411;&#65306;HR=2.35&#65292;95%CI&#65306;1.13~4.89&#65292;P=0.023&#65307;&#36827;&#23637;&#26399;&#65306;HR=5.44&#65292;95%CI&#65306;2.62~11.30&#65292;P<0.001&#65289;&#21644;&#34880;&#28165;&#946;2&#24494;&#29699;&#34507;&#30333;&#65288;HR=1.67&#65292;95%CI&#65306;1.08~2.58&#65292;P=0.021&#65289;&#26159;HL&#24739;&#32773;FFP&#30340;&#24433;&#21709;&#22240;&#32032;&#12290;116&#20363;r\/rHL&#24739;&#32773;&#35299;&#25937;&#27835;&#30103;&#30340;&#23436;&#20840;&#32531;&#35299;&#65288;CR&#65289;&#29575;&#20026;37.9%&#65288;95%CI&#65306;29.6%~47.0%&#65289;&#65292;&#20013;&#20301;&#26080;&#36827;&#23637;&#29983;&#23384;&#65288;PFS&#65289;&#20026;15.0&#20010;&#26376;&#65288;95%CI&#65306;9.9~20.1&#20010;&#26376;&#65289;&#65292;5&#24180;PFS&#29575;&#20026;29.9%&#65288;95%CI&#65306;20.9%~38.9%&#65289;&#65292;5&#24180;OS&#29575;&#20026;62.9%&#65288;95%CI&#65306;54.1%~71.7%&#65289;&#12290; &#32467;&#35770;&#65306; &#25509;&#21463;&#26631;&#20934;&#19968;&#32447;&#27835;&#30103;&#30340;HL&#24739;&#32773;&#39044;&#21518;&#33391;&#22909;&#65292;&#20294;&#22797;&#21457;&#25110;&#36827;&#23637;&#21518;&#27835;&#30103;&#25928;&#26524;&#19981;&#29702;&#24819;&#12290;.","query":"cancer"},"36319153":{"ArticleTitle":"[A multicenter study on childhood Hodgkin lymphoma treated with HL-2013 regimen in China].","AbstractText":"Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of the Hodgkin lymphoma (HL)-2013 regimen in the treatment of children with HL, and to investigate the prognostic factors of childhood HL. Methods: Clinical data of 145 children (aged &#8804;18 years) with newly diagnosed HL, treated with HL-2013 regimen in 8 tertiary referral centers for childhood cancer from August 2011 to April 2021 were analyzed retrospectively. All the diagnosis were confirmed by histopathological morphology and immunohistochemical examination. The clinical characteristics and treatment outcomes were summarized, and the patients were divided into different groups according to clinical characteristics. Kaplan-Meier method was used for survival analysis, and the comparison of survival rates between groups was performed with Log-rank test. Results: Of the 145 cases, there were 115 males and 30 females, the age at diagnosis was 7.9 (5.8, 10.6) years. Cervical lymph node enlargement (114 cases, 78.6%) was the common symptom of the disease, and 57 patients (39.3%) were accompanied by large masses. The most common pathological classification was mixed cell type (93 cases, 64.1%). According to the Ann Arbor staging system, there were 9 cases of stage &#8544;, 62 cases of stage &#8545;, 45 cases of stage &#8546;, 29 cases of stage &#8547;. According to the risk stratification: there were 14 cases of low-risk group, 76 cases of medium-risk group and 55 cases of high-risk group. Of all patients, 68 cases (46.9%) achieved an early complete remission (CR) after 2 courses of chemotherapy, and the CR rate was 93.8% (136\/145) after first-line treatment. Disease recurrence or progression occurred in 22 cases (15.2%). Of all patients, 125 cases survived, 6 cases died and 14 cases were lost to follow-up. Among the survived cases, 123 cases were continuously at CR state,and the follow-up time was 55 (40, 76) months. The 5-year overall survival (OS) and event free survival (EFS) rates were (95.3&#177;1.9)% and (84.2&#177;3.0)% for the entire group, respectively. 5-year OS and EFS rates for patients with stage &#8546;-&#8547; were both lower than those for patients with stage &#8544;-&#8545; (&#967;2=6.28 and 7.58, both P<0.05), the 5-year OS and EFS rates for patients in high-risk group were both lower than those for patients in low-risk and medium-risk group (&#967;2=10.93, 7.79, both P<0.05). The 5-year OS rates for the patient with early CR and without early CR were 100.0% and (90.9&#177;3.6)% (&#967;2=5.77, P=0.016). EFS rates for the patient with early CR (68 cases) and without early CR (77 cases) were (93.8&#177;3.0)% and (75.8&#177;5.0)% (&#967;2=8.78, P=0.003). Conclusions: HL-2013 regimen is significantly effective in the treatment of pediatric HL. However, the patients in high-risk group and those without early CR are prone to disease recurrence or progression.

Methods: A total of 27 patients with tongue cancer who underwent total glossectomy, neck lymph node dissection and anterolateral thigh flap transfer were collected from January 2019 to April 2021 in the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery at the Second Xiangya Hospital. All patients were males, the age ranged from 35-73 years. The patients were divided into experimental (14 cases) and control (13 cases) groups, based on whether the tongue was reconstructed. The clinical parameters of two groups were analyzed by independent sample t test or Fisher exact probability method. Results: The success rate of free flap was 100%, of the patients, 2 patients had cervical hematoma and 1 patient had wound infection postoperatively. There was no difference in speech (6.69&#177;3.42 vs. 5.50&#177;3.01, t=0.96, P=0.346) or swallowing (&#967;2=0.46, P=0.793) function between two groups at 1 month after surgery. However, the speech (24.94&#177;7.43 vs. 18.44&#177;6.30, t=2.48, P=0.020) and swallowing (&#967;2=6.97, P=0.008) functions in experimental group were significantly better than those in control group. No case was lost to follow-up. All patients were extubated after operation, with average time of 7.2 days in the experimental group and 7.7 days in the control group. The overall survival rate was 71.4% in the experimental group and 61.5% in the control group. Conclusion: The use of anterolateral thigh flap preforming tongue can improve the speech and swallowing functions in patients with total glossectomy and offer a novel method for tongue construction. &#30446;&#30340;&#65306; &#25506;&#35752;&#32929;&#21069;&#22806;&#20391;&#28216;&#31163;&#30382;&#29923;&#39044;&#25104;&#24418;&#33292;&#20307;&#22312;&#20840;&#33292;&#20999;&#38500;&#24739;&#32773;&#20013;&#30340;&#25928;&#26524;&#12290; &#26041;&#27861;&#65306; &#25910;&#38598;2019&#24180;1&#26376;&#33267;2021&#24180;4&#26376;&#20110;&#20013;&#21335;&#22823;&#23398;&#28248;&#38597;&#20108;&#21307;&#38498;&#34892;&#20840;&#33292;&#20999;&#38500;&#26415;&#21450;&#28107;&#24052;&#28165;&#25195;&#26415;&#65292;&#24182;&#20351;&#29992;&#32929;&#21069;&#22806;&#20391;&#28216;&#31163;&#30382;&#29923;&#20462;&#22797;&#37325;&#24314;&#30340;&#30149;&#20363;27&#20363;&#65292;&#22343;&#20026;&#30007;&#24615;&#24739;&#32773;&#65292;&#24180;&#40836;35~73&#23681;&#12290;&#20381;&#25454;&#26415;&#20013;&#26159;&#21542;&#37319;&#29992;&#30382;&#29923;&#39044;&#25104;&#24418;&#33292;&#20307;&#36827;&#34892;&#20998;&#32452;&#65292;&#35797;&#39564;&#32452;&#20026;&#26415;&#20013;&#20351;&#29992;&#30382;&#29923;&#39044;&#25104;&#24418;&#33292;&#20307;&#65288;14&#20363;&#65289;&#65292;&#23545;&#29031;&#32452;&#20026;&#26415;&#20013;&#26410;&#39044;&#25104;&#24418;&#33292;&#20307;&#65288;13&#20363;&#65289;&#12290;&#20998;&#26512;&#35797;&#39564;&#32452;&#19982;&#23545;&#29031;&#32452;&#30340;&#20020;&#24202;&#36164;&#26009;&#65292;&#35745;&#37327;&#36164;&#26009;&#12289;&#35745;&#25968;&#36164;&#26009;&#20998;&#21035;&#20351;&#29992;&#29420;&#31435;&#26679;&#26412;t&#26816;&#39564;&#21644;Fisher&#30830;&#20999;&#27010;&#29575;&#27861;&#36827;&#34892;&#20998;&#26512;&#12290; &#32467;&#26524;&#65306; 2&#20363;&#24739;&#32773;&#26415;&#21518;&#39048;&#37096;&#34880;&#32959;&#65292;1&#20363;&#24739;&#32773;&#26415;&#21518;&#39048;&#37096;&#20260;&#21475;&#24863;&#26579;&#65292;&#23545;&#30151;&#22788;&#29702;&#21518;&#22343;&#27835;&#24840;&#12290;&#26412;&#30740;&#31350;&#24739;&#32773;&#30382;&#29923;&#25104;&#21151;&#29575;&#20026;100%&#12290;&#35797;&#39564;&#32452;&#21644;&#23545;&#29031;&#32452;&#26415;&#21518;1&#20010;&#26376;&#35821;&#38899;&#28165;&#26224;&#24230;&#65339;&#65288;6.69&#177;3.42&#65289;&#20998;&#27604;&#65288;5.50&#177;3.01&#65289;&#20998;&#65292;t=0.96&#65292;P=0.346&#65341;&#21450;&#21534;&#21693;&#21151;&#33021;&#65288;&#967;2=0.46&#65292;P=0.793&#65289;&#24046;&#24322;&#26080;&#32479;&#35745;&#23398;&#24847;&#20041;&#12290;&#26415;&#21518;6&#20010;&#26376;&#26102;&#65292;&#35797;&#39564;&#32452;&#30340;&#35821;&#38899;&#28165;&#26224;&#24230;&#36739;&#23545;&#29031;&#32452;&#26126;&#26174;&#25913;&#21892;&#65339;&#65288;24.94&#177;7.43&#65289;&#20998;&#27604;&#65288;18.44&#177;6.30&#65289;&#20998;&#65292;t=2.48&#65292;P=0.020&#65341;&#65292;&#21534;&#21693;&#21151;&#33021;&#19982;&#23545;&#29031;&#32452;&#30456;&#27604;&#24046;&#24322;&#26377;&#32479;&#35745;&#23398;&#24847;&#20041;&#65288;&#967;2=6.97&#65292;P=0.008&#65289;&#12290;&#38543;&#35775;6~24&#20010;&#26376;&#65292;&#26080;&#22833;&#35775;&#30149;&#20363;&#65292;&#25152;&#26377;&#24739;&#32773;&#26415;&#21518;&#22343;&#25300;&#38500;&#27668;&#31649;&#22871;&#31649;&#65292;&#25300;&#31649;&#26102;&#38388;&#35797;&#39564;&#32452;&#24179;&#22343;&#20026;7.2 d&#65292;&#23545;&#29031;&#32452;&#24179;&#22343;&#20026;7.7 d&#12290;&#35797;&#39564;&#32452;&#24635;&#29983;&#23384;&#29575;&#20026;71.4%&#65292;&#23545;&#29031;&#32452;&#24635;&#29983;&#23384;&#20026;61.5%&#12290; &#32467;&#35770;&#65306; &#32929;&#21069;&#22806;&#20391;&#30382;&#29923;&#39044;&#25104;&#24418;&#33292;&#20307;&#30340;&#26041;&#27861;&#21487;&#20197;&#36739;&#22909;&#22320;&#24674;&#22797;&#24739;&#32773;&#26415;&#21518;&#30340;&#21534;&#21693;&#21450;&#35328;&#35821;&#21151;&#33021;&#65292;&#20026;&#20840;&#33292;&#20999;&#38500;&#24739;&#32773;&#30340;&#37325;&#24314;&#26041;&#26696;&#25552;&#20379;&#19968;&#31181;&#26032;&#30340;&#36873;&#25321;&#12290;.","query":"cancer"},"36319128":{"ArticleTitle":"[Application of lateral upper arm free flap in the repair of postoperative defects of oral cancer].","AbstractText":"Objective: To explore the clinical application and efficacy of lateral upper arm free flap (LUAFF) for one-stage repairing of soft tissue defect after oral cancer surgery. Methods: This article was a retrospective analysis of clinical data of 46 patients receiving treatment of one-stage repairing of soft tissue defect with LUAFF after oral cancer surgery in Hunan Cancer Hospital, from June 2019 to June 2021. Among these cases, 40 were males, and 6 were females. The patients' ages were from 23 to 64 years old. The clinical data of patients were reviewed and outcomes were evaluated. SPSS 23.0 software was used for statistical analysis. Results: In the LUAFF of 46 patients, flap area ranged from 5.0 cm&#215;3.5 cm to 15.0 cm&#215;7.0 cm; the mean pedicle length was 8.15&#177;1.42 cm; the mean artery diameter was 1.20&#177;0.41 mm (range, 1.5 to 2.5 mm); the mean diameter of the largest veins was 2.15&#177;0.52 mm; and the median number of perforators was 2.6 (range, 1 to 4). All donor sites were closed primarily. Two cases had arterial anastomosis thrombosis, but their flaps were successfully saved with urgent re-anastomosis of the vessels. The overall flap survival rate was 93.5%(43\/46), with flap necroses after operation in three cases. No patient received tracheotomy. The average hospital stay time of patients after operation was 9.4 days. The follow-up time was 6-24 months, elbow and wrist movements on the operative side were normal, and the upper limb muscle strength was not affected. Conclusions: LUAFF is a suitable choice for the repairs of small-moderate tissue defects in oral cancer surgery, with consistent perforators in the flap, simple harvest method, concealed donor-site scar, and high survival rate. &#30446;&#30340;&#65306; &#25506;&#35752;&#28216;&#31163;&#19978;&#33218;&#22806;&#20391;&#30382;&#29923;&#20462;&#22797;&#21475;&#33108;&#30284;&#26415;&#21518;&#32570;&#25439;&#30340;&#20020;&#24202;&#24212;&#29992;&#21450;&#25928;&#26524;&#12290; &#26041;&#27861;&#65306; &#22238;&#39038;&#24615;&#20998;&#26512;2019&#24180;6&#26376;&#33267;2021&#24180;6&#26376;&#28246;&#21335;&#30465;&#32959;&#30244;&#21307;&#38498;&#24212;&#29992;&#28216;&#31163;&#19978;&#33218;&#22806;&#20391;&#30382;&#29923;&#20462;&#22797;&#21475;&#33108;&#30284;&#26415;&#21518;&#32570;&#25439;&#30340;46&#20363;&#20020;&#24202;&#36164;&#26009;&#65292;&#20854;&#20013;&#30007;&#24615;40&#20363;&#65292;&#22899;&#24615;6&#20363;&#65292;&#24180;&#40836;23~64&#23681;&#12290;&#24635;&#32467;&#30382;&#29923;&#22823;&#23567;&#12289;&#34880;&#31649;&#33922;&#30340;&#38271;&#24230;&#12289;&#34880;&#31649;&#30452;&#24452;&#12289;&#31359;&#25903;&#25968;&#37327;&#12289;&#30382;&#29923;&#23384;&#27963;&#29575;&#12289;&#20379;&#21306;&#24182;&#21457;&#30151;&#20197;&#21450;&#24739;&#32773;&#26415;&#21518;&#20303;&#38498;&#26102;&#38388;&#21450;&#30103;&#25928;&#12290;&#37319;&#29992;SPSS 23.0&#36719;&#20214;&#36827;&#34892;&#32479;&#35745;&#23398;&#20998;&#26512;&#12290; &#32467;&#26524;&#65306; 46&#20363;&#24739;&#32773;&#20013;&#65292;&#30382;&#29923;&#22823;&#23567;5.0 cm&#215;3.5 cm~15.0 cm&#215;7.0 cm&#65292;&#34880;&#31649;&#33922;&#38271;&#24230;&#65288;8.15&#177;1.42&#65289;cm&#65292;&#21160;&#33033;&#30452;&#24452;&#65288;1.20&#177;0.41&#65289;mm&#65292;&#38745;&#33033;&#30452;&#24452;&#65288;2.15&#177;0.52&#65289;mm&#65292;&#31359;&#25903;&#25968;&#37327;1~4&#25903;&#65288;&#24179;&#22343;2.6&#25903;&#65289;&#65292;&#20379;&#21306;&#20999;&#21475;&#22343;&#19968;&#26399;&#25289;&#25314;&#32541;&#21512;&#12290;2&#20363;&#24739;&#32773;&#26415;&#21518;&#20986;&#29616;&#30382;&#29923;&#21160;&#33033;&#21563;&#21512;&#21475;&#34880;&#26643;&#65292;&#20104;&#20197;&#28165;&#38500;&#34880;&#26643;&#37325;&#26032;&#21563;&#21512;&#34880;&#31649;&#21518;&#65292;&#30382;&#29923;&#25250;&#25937;&#25104;&#21151;&#12290;3&#20363;&#30382;&#29923;&#22351;&#27515;&#65292;&#30382;&#29923;&#25104;&#27963;&#29575;&#20026;93.5%&#65288;43\/46&#65289;&#12290;46&#20363;&#24739;&#32773;&#22343;&#26410;&#34892;&#27668;&#31649;&#20999;&#24320;&#12290;&#24739;&#32773;&#26415;&#21518;&#24179;&#22343;&#20303;&#38498;&#26102;&#38388;&#20026;9.4 d&#12290;&#38543;&#35775;&#26102;&#38388;6~24&#20010;&#26376;&#65292;&#24739;&#32773;&#26415;&#20391;&#32920;&#20851;&#33410;&#21450;&#33109;&#20851;&#33410;&#27963;&#21160;&#27491;&#24120;&#65292;&#19978;&#32930;&#32908;&#21147;&#26080;&#24433;&#21709;&#12290; &#32467;&#35770;&#65306; &#19978;&#33218;&#22806;&#20391;&#30382;&#29923;&#21046;&#22791;&#31616;&#21333;&#12289;&#20999;&#21475;&#38544;&#34109;&#12289;&#30382;&#29923;&#25104;&#27963;&#29575;&#36739;&#39640;&#65292;&#26159;&#20462;&#22797;&#21475;&#33108;&#30284;&#26415;&#21518;&#20013;&#23567;&#22411;&#36719;&#32452;&#32455;&#32570;&#25439;&#30340;&#19968;&#31181;&#33391;&#22909;&#36873;&#25321;&#12290;.","query":"cancer"},"36319116":{"ArticleTitle":"Oligometastatic Prostate Cancer: Current Status and Future Challenges.","AbstractText":"In accordance with the spectrum theory of metastatic disease, an oligometastatic clinical state has been proposed as an intermediary step along the natural history of cancer with few (typically 1-3) metastatic lesions identifiable on imaging that may be amenable to metastasis-directed therapy. Effective therapy of oligometastatic disease is anticipated to impact cancer evolution by delaying progression and improving patient outcome at a minimal or acceptable cost of toxicity. There has been increasing recognition of oligometastatic disease in prostate cancer with the advent of new-generation imaging agents, most notably the recently approved PET radiotracers based on targeting prostate-specific membrane antigen. Early clinical trials with metastasis-directed therapy of oligometastases have provided evidence for delaying the employment of systematic therapy and improving outcome in selected patients. Despite these encouraging results, much needs to be investigated and learned about the underlying biology of the oligometastatic state along the evolutionary clinical course of prostate cancer, the identification of relevant imaging and nonimaging predictive and prognostic biomarkers, and the development of treatment strategies to optimize short-term and long-term patient outcome. We provide a review of the current status and the lingering challenges of this rapidly evolving clinical space in prostate cancer.","query":"cancer"},"36319107":{"ArticleTitle":"[Research progress on the role of FOXOs family in cancer].","AbstractText":"The Forkhead box class O proteins (FOXOs) family consists of highly conserved transcription factors, including FOXO1, FOXO3, FOXO4 and FOXO6. Each member of the FOXOs family is ubiquitously expressed and involved in regulating many biological activities such as tumor cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration and oxidative stress. The activity of FOXOs is mainly regulated by post-translational modification, and its inactivation is mainly mediated by the over-activation of its upstream modifying enzymes, which provides a possibility to use drugs to recover its activity. It is worth noting that FOXOs can not only inhibit, but also promote the occurrence and development of human tumors due to the complex effects of FOXOs. This review will summarize the structure and activity regulation of FOXOs, and discuss their tumor inhibiting effects by limiting cell proliferation and inducing apoptosis, as well as their tumor promoting effects by maintaining cell homeostasis, promoting metastasis and inducing drug resistance, so as to provide new ideas for the pathological research of related diseases and open up new ways to promote broader prevention and treatment strategies.","query":"cancer"},"36319079":{"ArticleTitle":"The avoiding late diagnosis of ovarian cancer (ALDO) project; a pilot national surveillance programme for women with pathogenic germline variants in BRCA1 and BRCA2.","AbstractText":"Our study aimed to establish 'real-world' performance and cost-effectiveness of ovarian cancer (OC) surveillance in women with pathogenic germline BRCA1\/2 variants who defer risk-reducing bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO). Our study recruited 875 female BRCA1\/2-heterozygotes at 13 UK centres and via an online media campaign, with 767 undergoing at least one 4-monthly surveillance test with the Risk of Ovarian Cancer Algorithm (ROCA) test. Surveillance performance was calculated with modelling of occult cancers detected at RRSO. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated using Markov population cohort simulation. Our study identified 8 OCs during 1277&#8201;women screen years: 2 occult OCs at RRSO (both stage 1a), and 6 screen-detected; 3 of 6 (50%) were &#8804;stage 3a and 5 of 6 (83%) were completely surgically cytoreduced. Modelled sensitivity, specificity, Positive Predictive Value (PPV) and Negative Predictive Value (NPV) for OC were 87.5% (95% CI, 47.3 to 99.7), 99.9% (99.9-100), 75% (34.9-96.8) and 99.9% (99.9-100), respectively. The predicted number of quality-adjusted life years (QALY) gained by surveillance was 0.179 with an ICER cost-saving of -&#163;102,496\/QALY. OC surveillance for women deferring RRSO in a 'real-world' setting is feasible and demonstrates similar performance to research trials; it down-stages OC, leading to a high complete cytoreduction rate and is cost-saving in the UK National Health Service (NHS) setting. While RRSO remains recommended management, ROCA-based surveillance may be considered for female BRCA-heterozygotes who are deferring such surgery.","query":"cancer"},"36319076":{"ArticleTitle":"Correlation between PD-L1 expression of the tumour cells and lymphocytes infiltration in the invasive front of urothelial carcinoma.","AbstractText":"Programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) as a cell surface glycoprotein can inhibit T cell function when binding to its receptor, PD-1. The newly developed therapy of targeting PD-1\/PD-L1 signal pathway has shown great promise for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer as well as melanoma. Approved by Food and Drug Administration, atezolizumab has become the first new drug to treat advanced bladder cancer. The aim of this study is to evaluate whether PD-L1 is associated with the lymphocytes infiltration in the tumour microenvironment and to assess the prognostic value of PD-L1 expression. Among 96 invasive bladder urothelial carcinomas, some were used to construct tissue-microarrays, and some cases with shallow infiltration or large heterogeneity were performed, respectively, for the following work. By means of immunohistochemistry and HE, PD-L1 expression and immune cell infiltration in the invasive front of urothelial carcinoma were analysed. We find that PD-L1 expression in tumour cells and lymphocytes are significantly associated with more tumour infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and more T cells. The integrated TILs, T-PD-L1 and I-PD-L1 are not significantly correlated with the overall survival (OS) of patients. However, the combination of T-PD-L1 and TILs, T-PD-L1 and I-PD-L1 is significantly correlated with the OS of patients. The T-PD-L1 (-)\/TIL (-) group show the best prognosis and the T-PD-L1 (+)\/I-PD-L1 (-) group show the worst prognosis. Furthermore, a multivariate analysis reveal that PD-L1 expression of lymphocytes is an independent prognostic factor for OS of patients. Our study reveal that PD-L1 of tumour cells are associated with the corresponding T cells infiltration and that the combination of T-PD-L1 and I-PD-L1, T-PD-L1 and TILs could be a relevant marker for the determination of the prognostic role of patients with the urothelial carcinoma.","query":"cancer"},"36319070":{"ArticleTitle":"IVIVE of Bexarotene Metabolism in The Presence of Chronic Kidney Disease and Acute Kidney Injury in Rat Using PBPK Modeling and Extrapolation to Human.","AbstractText":"Renal impairment was associated with increased bexarotene fraction unbound in plasma, decreased in vitro intrinsic clearance, and in vivo total plasma clearance in rats.

Two patients died from severe COVID-19 (2.7 deaths\/100 patient-years).Efficacy: the targeted treatment was considered effective by the clinician in 56% of patients and allowed, in responders, a median reduction of oral corticosteroids of 15 (9 to 21) mg\/day, below 7.5 mg\/day in 76% of patients, while 28% discontinued. These initial results of the TATA registry confirm the diversity of targeted treatments prescribed off-label in refractory autoimmune diseases and their corticosteroid-sparing effect when effective. Tolerance was acceptable in these refractory patients with a long history of treatment with immunosuppressive drugs.","query":"cancer"},"36319065":{"ArticleTitle":"Adaptive single-KIR+NKG2C+ NK cells expanded from select superdonors show potent missing-self reactivity and efficiently control HLA-mismatched acute myeloid leukemia.","AbstractText":"Natural killer (NK) cells hold great promise as a source for allogeneic cell therapy against hematological malignancies, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Current treatments are hampered by variability in NK cell subset responses, a limitation which could be circumvented by specific expansion of highly potent single killer immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR)+NKG2C+ adaptive NK cells to maximize missing-self reactivity. We developed a GMP-compliant protocol to expand adaptive NK cells from cryopreserved cells derived from select third-party superdonors, that is, donors harboring large adaptive NK cell subsets with desired KIR specificities at baseline. We studied the adaptive state of the cell product (ADAPT-NK) by flow cytometry and mass cytometry as well as cellular indexing of transcriptomes and epitopes by sequencing (CITE-Seq). We investigated the functional responses of ADAPT-NK cells against a wide range of tumor target cell lines and primary AML samples using flow cytometry and IncuCyte as well as in a mouse model of AML. ADAPT-NK cells were >90% pure with a homogeneous expression of a single self-HLA specific KIR and expanded a median of 470-fold. The ADAPT-NK cells largely retained their adaptive transcriptional signature with activation of effector programs without signs of exhaustion. ADAPT-NK cells showed high degranulation capacity and efficient killing of HLA-C\/KIR mismatched tumor cell lines as well as primary leukemic blasts from AML patients. Finally, the expanded adaptive NK cells had preserved robust antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity potential and combination of ADAPT-NK cells with an anti-CD16\/IL-15\/anti-CD33 tri-specific engager led to near-complete killing of resistant CD45dim blast subtypes. These preclinical data demonstrate the feasibility of off-the-shelf therapy with a non-engineered, yet highly specific, NK cell population with full missing-self recognition capability.","query":"cancer"},"36319064":{"ArticleTitle":"Deciphering molecular and cellular ex vivo responses to bispecific antibodies PD1-TIM3 and PD1-LAG3 in human tumors.","AbstractText":"Next-generation cancer immunotherapies are designed to broaden the therapeutic repertoire by targeting new immune checkpoints including lymphocyte-activation gene 3 (LAG-3) and T cell immunoglobulin and mucin-domain containing-3 (TIM-3). Yet, the molecular and cellular mechanisms by which either receptor functions to mediate its inhibitory effects are still poorly understood. Similarly, little is known on the differential effects of dual, compared with single, checkpoint inhibition. We here performed in-depth characterization, including multicolor flow cytometry, single cell RNA sequencing and multiplex supernatant analysis, using tumor single cell suspensions from patients with cancer treated ex vivo with novel bispecific antibodies targeting programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and TIM-3 (PD1-TIM3), PD-1 and LAG-3 (PD1-LAG3), or with anti-PD-1. We identified patient samples which were responsive to PD1-TIM3, PD1-LAG3 or anti-PD-1 using an in vitro approach, validated by the analysis of 659 soluble proteins and enrichment for an anti-PD-1 responder signature. We found increased abundance of an activated (HLA-DR+CD25+GranzymeB+) CD8+ T cell subset and of proliferating CD8+ T cells, in response to bispecific antibody or anti-PD-1 treatment. Bispecific antibodies, but not anti-PD-1, significantly increased the abundance of a proliferating natural killer cell subset, which exhibited enrichment for a tissue-residency signature. Key phenotypic and transcriptional changes occurred in a PD-1+CXCL13+CD4+ T cell subset, in response to all treatments, including increased interleukin-17 secretion and signaling toward plasma cells. Interestingly, LAG-3 protein upregulation was detected as a unique pharmacodynamic effect mediated by PD1-LAG3, but not by PD1-TIM3 or anti-PD-1. Our in vitro system reliably assessed responses to bispecific antibodies co-targeting PD-1 together with LAG-3 or TIM-3 using patients' tumor infiltrating immune cells and revealed transcriptional and phenotypic imprinting by bispecific antibody formats currently tested in early clinical trials.","query":"cancer"},"36319063":{"ArticleTitle":"MiR-125b-5p modulates the function of regulatory T cells in tumor microenvironment by targeting TNFR2.","AbstractText":"Tumor necrosis factor receptor type 2 (TNFR2) is primarily expressed by CD4+FoxP3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs), especially those present in tumor microenvironment. There is compelling evidence that TNFR2 plays a crucial role in the activation, expansion, and phenotypic stability of Tregs and promotes tumor immune evasion. Understanding of epigenetic regulation of TNFR2 expression in Tregs may help device a novel strategy in cancer immunotherapy. MiR-125b-5p-overexpressing or knockdown murine CD4 T cells and Tregs were constructed, and the effect of miR-125b-5p on Tregs proliferation, suppressive function and TNFR2 expression were examined. In vivo antitumor efficacy of Ago-125b-5p (miR-125b-5p agomir) was evaluated in MC38 tumor bearing mice, and tumor-infiltrating Tregs and CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) were analyzed. RNA-seq analysis was applied to reveal the genes and signaling pathways regulated by miR-125b-5p in Tregs. In this study, we found that TNFR2 was a direct target of miR-125b-5p. Overexpression of miR-125b-5p decreased the proportion of Tregs and their expression of TNFR2 and consequently inhibited its proliferation and suppressive function by regulating the metabolism-related signaling pathways. Moreover, in colon cancer bearing mice, the administration of Ago-125b-5p markedly inhibited the tumor growth, which was associated with reduction of Tregs and increase of IFN&#947;+CD8+ T cells in tumor environment. Furthermore, in human colon adenocarcinoma patients, we verified that miR-125b-5p expression was downregulated, and low levels of miR-125b-5p were associated with poor prognosis. Interestingly, the expression of miR-125b-5p and TNFR2 were negatively correlated. Our study for the first time found that the expression of TNFR2 by Tregs was regulated by miR-125b-5p. Our results showed that miR-125b-5p had the capacity to inhibit the expression of TNFR2 and immunosuppressive activity of Tregs and consequently enhanced the antitumor efficacy. This property of miR-125b-5p may be therapeutically harnessed in the treatment of human cancers.","query":"cancer"},"36319062":{"ArticleTitle":"Tanshinone functions as a coenzyme that confers gain of function of NQO1 to suppress ferroptosis.","AbstractText":"Ferroptosis is triggered by the breakdown of cellular iron-dependent redox homeostasis and the abnormal accumulation of lipid ROS. Cells have evolved defense mechanisms to prevent lipid ROS accumulation and ferroptosis. Using a library of more than 4,000 bioactive compounds, we show that tanshinone from Salvia miltiorrhiza (Danshen) has very potent inhibitory activity against ferroptosis. Mechanistically, we found that tanshinone functions as a coenzyme for NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), which detoxifies lipid peroxyl radicals and inhibits ferroptosis both in vitro and in vivo. Although NQO1 is recognized as an oxidative stress response gene, it does not appear to have a direct role in ferroptosis inhibition in the absence of tanshinone. Here, we demonstrate a gain of function of NQO1 induced by tanshinone, which is a novel mechanism for ferroptosis inhibition. Using mouse models of acute liver injury and ischemia\/reperfusion heart injury, we observed that tanshinone displays protective effects in both the liver and the heart in a manner dependent on NQO1. Our results link the clinical use of tanshinone to its activity in ferroptosis inhibition.","query":"cancer"},"36319059":{"ArticleTitle":"Digitally distributed Yoga Intervention in Breast Cancer Rehabilitation (DigiYoga CaRe): protocol for a randomised controlled trial.","AbstractText":"Breast cancer is the most prevalent cancer among women. The treatment is extensive; in addition to surgery, various combinations of radiation therapy, chemotherapy and antibody and endocrine treatment can be applied. Cancer-related fatigue (CRF) is high in patients with breast cancer, peaking during chemotherapy, but may persist for several years. Physical activity has proven to be effective in reducing CRF in breast cancer rehabilitation, but many patients tend to be less active after the diagnosis. Yoga has a previously demonstrated effect on energy levels and digitally distributed yoga intervention can potentially increase accessibility in pandemic times and facilitate participation for patients susceptible to infection and those living far from organised rehabilitation opportunities. The purpose of this study, Digital Yoga Intervention in Cancer Rehabilitation (DigiYoga CaRe) is to investigate whether a 12-week digitally distributed yoga intervention can reduce CRF and stress, improve health-related quality of life (HRQL) and affect pro-inflammatory and metabolic markers in patients with breast cancer. This multicentre study will adopt a randomised controlled design including 240 persons after their breast cancer surgery. They will be randomised to a 12-week digitally distributed yoga intervention or to a control group. The intervention group practice yoga two times a week, one yoga class live-streamed to the patient's computer or mobile device and one prerecorded video class for self-training. The controls receive standardised care, gift cards for flowers and access to yoga video links after the data collection has ended. The primary analysis will be performed following the principle of intention to treat. Data will be collected by questionnaires, blood samples, accelerometers and interviews. The DigiYoga CaRe study was approved by the Regional Ethical Review Board in Lund.

In this population-based study in Ontario, Canada, we compared age-standardized incidence rates for immigrant males from various regions of origin with the rates of long-term residents. In this retrospective cohort study, we linked several provincial-level databases available at ICES, an independent, non-profit research institute. We included all males aged 20 years and older in the province of Ontario eligible for health care for each fiscal year (Apr. 1 to Mar. 31) in 2008-2016. We determined age-standardized prostate cancer incidence rates, stratifying by immigrant status (a binary variable) and region of origin. We used a log-binomial model to estimate adjusted incidence rate ratios, with long-term residents (Canadian-born Ontarians as well as those who immigrated before 1985, when available data on immigration starts) as the reference group. We included age, neighbourhood income and time since landing in the models. Additional models limited to immigrant males in the cohort included immigration admission category (economic class, family class, refugee, other) and time since landing in Canada. There were 74594 incident cases of prostate cancer in the study period, 6742 of which were among immigrant males. Males who had immigrated from West Africa and the Caribbean had significantly higher incidence of prostate cancer than other immigrants and long-term residents: adjusted rate ratios of 2.71 (95% confidence interval [CI] 2.41-3.05) and 1.91 (95% CI 1.78-2.04), respectively. Immigrants from other regions, including East Africa and Middle-Southern Africa, had lower or similar incidence rates to long-term residents. Males from South Asia had the lowest adjusted rate ratio (0.47, 95% CI 0.45-0.50). The age-standardized incidence rate of prostate cancer from 2008 to 2016 was consistently and significantly higher among immigrants from West African and Caribbean countries than among other immigrants and long-term residents of the province. Future research in Canada should focus on further understanding heterogeneity in prostate cancer risk and epidemiology, including stage of diagnosis and mortality, for immigrants.","query":"cancer"},"36319025":{"ArticleTitle":"Association between Goals of Care Designation orders and health care resource use among seriously ill older adults in acute care: a multicentre prospective cohort study.","AbstractText":"The Goals of Care Designation (GCD) is a medical order used to communicate the focus of a patient's care in Alberta, Canada.

This was a prospective cohort study of newly hospitalized inpatients in Alberta conducted from January to September 2017. Participants were aged 55 years or older with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, congestive heart failure, cirrhosis, cancer or renal failure; aged 55-79 years and their provider answered \"no\" to the \"surprise question\" (i.e., provider would not be surprised if the patient died in the next 6 months); or aged 80 years or older with any acute condition. The exposure of interest was GCD. The primary outcome was health care resource use during admission, measured by length of stay (LOS), intensive care unit hours, Resource Intensity Weights (RIWs), flagged interventions and palliative care referral. The secondary outcome was 30-day readmission. Adjusted regression analyses were performed (adjusted for age, sex, race and ethnicity, Clinical Frailty Scale score, comorbidities and city). We included 475 study participants. The median age was 83 (interquartile range 77-87) years, and 93.7% had a GCD at enrolment.

A total five-year survival rate after axillary lymph dissection and sentinel lymph node biopsy was 91% and 92%, respectively. A five-year recurrence-free survival rate after axillary lymph dissection was approximately 82.2%, and after sentinel lymph node biopsy - 83.9%. Regional recurrence in the sentinel lymph nodes on the affected side were found in only 1.1% of cases.

Conclusions: The results suggest that changing the radiological order by starting with US has a short-term positive effect on overall QoL, anxiety, and DBT pain experience in symptomatic women. Owing to its negative impact, biopsies should be performed cautiously. In conclusion, the moment of reassurance for women advances by reversing the radiological order according to the BUST, showing the high importance of human interaction in diagnostic care in addition to the clinical performance of imaging modalities.","query":"cancer"},"36318793":{"ArticleTitle":"Eleven-Year Experience with Selective Adrenal Vein Sampling in Management of Primary Adrenal Hormonal Hypersecretion.","AbstractText":"Introduction: Nearly half of the adult population in the United States has been diagnosed with hypertension. Adrenal hormonal hypersecretion is a leading cause of secondary hypertension. Adrenal vein sampling (AVS) may assist in differentiating between unilateral and bilateral adrenal hormonal hypersecretion to identify patients who are candidates for adrenalectomy. We reviewed the use of AVS at our institution along with associated outcomes after adrenalectomy. Materials and Methods: A retrospective chart review was conducted of patients with a diagnosis of primary hyperaldosteronism (PA) or adrenocorticotropic hormone-independent Cushing syndrome (AICS) and who underwent adrenalectomy between January 1, 2010, and December 1, 2021. Patient data of baseline characteristics, preoperative workup, including AVS, and postoperative outcomes were collected and analyzed. Results: Seventy-one patients were identified in the study period (48 PA and 23 AICS). Computed tomography scan identified unilateral adrenal nodules in 52 patients (29 left; and 23 right), bilateral nodules in 13 patients, and no nodules in 6 patients. AVS was performed in 45 patients with PA (93%) and 5 patients with AICS (21%). After surgery, the number of PA patients with hypokalemia or requiring potassium supplementation significantly decreased after adrenalectomy (before surgery: 33 [68.7%]; and after surgery: 5 [10.4%], P&#8201;<&#8201;.01). The number of medications required for hypertension in AICS patients also significantly decreased. No major adverse events were noted. Conclusions: Our long-term experience demonstrates the ongoing use of AVS during workup of patients with primary hyperaldosteronism and for select patients with adrenocorticotropic hormone-independent Cushing syndrome. However, a low level of discordance between imaging and AVS findings in PA patients suggests that there may be a subset of patients in whom preoperative AVS is not necessary.","query":"cancer"},"36318766":{"ArticleTitle":"Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Women's Health Care Access: A Cross-Sectional Study.","AbstractText":"Background: There has been limited study of how the COVID-19 pandemic has affected women's health care access. Our study aims to examine the prevalence and correlates of COVID-19-related disruptions to (1) primary care; (2) gynecologic care; and (3) preventive health care among women. Materials and Methods: We recruited 4,000 participants from a probability-based online panel. We conducted four multinomial logistic regression models, one for each of the study outcomes: (1) primary care access; (2) gynecologic care access; (3) patient-initiated disruptions to preventive visits; and (4) provider-initiated disruptions to preventive visits. Results: The sample included 1,285 women. One in four women (28.5%) reported that the pandemic affected their primary care access. Sexual minority women (SMW) (odds ratios [OR]: 1.67; 95% confidence intervals [CI]: 1.19-2.33) had higher odds of reporting pandemic-related effects on primary care access compared to women identifying as heterosexual. Cancer survivors (OR: 2.07; 95% CI: 1.25-3.42) had higher odds of reporting pandemic-related effects on primary care access compared to women without a cancer history. About 16% of women reported that the pandemic affected their gynecologic care access. Women with a cancer history (OR: 2.34; 95% CI: 1.35-4.08) had higher odds of reporting pandemic-related effects on gynecologic care compared to women without a cancer history. SMW were more likely to report patient- and provider-initiated delays in preventive health care. Other factors that affected health care access included income, insurance status, and having a usual source of care. Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted women's health care access and disproportionately affected access among SMW and women with a cancer history, suggesting that targeted interventions may be needed to ensure adequate health care access during the COVID-19 pandemic.","query":"cancer"},"36318763":{"ArticleTitle":"Correction: A Web-Based Prostate Cancer-Specific Holistic Needs Assessment (CHAT-P): Multimethod Study From Concept to Clinical Practice.","AbstractText":"[This corrects the article DOI: 10.2196\/32153.].","query":"cancer"},"36318757":{"ArticleTitle":"Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen Targeted Deep Tumor Penetration of Polymer Nanocarriers.","AbstractText":"Tumoral uptake of large-size nanoparticles is mediated by the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect, with variable accumulation and heterogenous tumor tissue penetration depending on the tumor phenotype. The performance of nanocarriers via specific targeting has the potential to improve imaging contrast and therapeutic efficacy in vivo with increased deep tissue penetration. To address this hypothesis, we designed and synthesized prostate cancer-targeting starPEG nanocarriers (40 kDa, 15 nm), [89Zr]PEG-(DFB)3(ACUPA)1 and [89Zr]PEG-(DFB)1(ACUPA)3, with one or three prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-targeting ACUPA ligands. The in vitro PSMA binding affinity and in vivo pharmacokinetics of the targeted nanocarriers were compared with a nontargeted starPEG, [89Zr]PEG-(DFB)4, in PSMA+ PC3-Pip and PSMA- PC3-Flu cells, and xenografts. Increasing the number of ACUPA ligands improved the in vitro binding affinity of PEG-derived polymers to PC3-Pip cells. While both PSMA-targeted nanocarriers significantly improved tissue penetration in PC3-Pip tumors, the multivalent [89Zr]PEG-(DFB)1(ACUPA)3 showed a remarkably higher PC3-Pip\/blood ratio and background clearance. In contrast, the nontargeted [89Zr]PEG-(DFB)4 showed low EPR-mediated accumulation with poor tumor tissue penetration. Overall, ACUPA conjugated targeted starPEGs significantly improve tumor retention with deep tumor tissue penetration in low EPR PC3-Pip xenografts. These data suggest that PSMA targeting with multivalent ACUPA ligands may be a generally applicable strategy to increase nanocarrier delivery to prostate cancer. These targeted multivalent nanocarriers with high tumor binding and low healthy tissue retention could be employed in imaging and therapeutic applications.","query":"cancer"},"36318746":{"ArticleTitle":"Radioprotective effect of mistletoe extract on intestinal toxicity: in vivo study using adult zebrafish.","AbstractText":"The intestine is a dose-limiting organ in the treatment of intra-abdominal cancer. We previously reported that the extract of mistletoe parasites on Quercus had a more potent radioprotective effect than amifostine in reducing the developmental toxicities of zebrafish embryos.

Wild-type adult AB zebrafish were exposed to 45-50&#8201;Gy of photon beam irradiation and\/or treated with mistletoe extract orally 1&#8201;h before. The main endpoints of the study were survival and degree of deformation of the intestinal villi. The median follow-up period was 10 days post-irradiation (range:7-11 days). A total of 105 zebrafish were used, including 42 in the radiation alone, 42 in the radiation and mistletoe arms, and 21 control subjects (mistletoe alone, mock-irradiated arm). The rate of both significant deformity and death was 53% in the radiation-alone arm, whereas the corresponding rate was 30% in the radiation and mistletoe arms. Significant deformity-free survival rates at 10 days post-irradiation in the radiation alone, and radiation and mistletoe arms were 44.7% (95% confidence interval [CI]:20-54.3) and 68.4% (95% CI:53.8-86.8), respectively (p&#8201;=&#8201;0.046). The radiation and mistletoe arms showed decreased expression of two of three inflammatory genes (IL-1&#946; and IL-6) compared to the radiation alone group (p < 0.05). The radioprotective effect against intestinal toxicity was successfully shown in an adult zebrafish model. This result suggests the possibility of clinical use of mistletoe extract for the treatment of abdominal cancers.","query":"cancer"},"36318743":{"ArticleTitle":"Rose Bengal Decorated NaYF4:Tb Nanoparticles for Low Dose X-ray-Induced Photodynamic Therapy in Cancer Cells.","AbstractText":"The use of scintillating nanoparticles (ScNPs) in X-ray-induced photodynamic therapy (X-PDT) is a technique for deep tissue-localized tumor therapy with few side effects. ScNPs transfer X-ray-induced energy to photosensitizers, which generate massive amounts of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and kill cancer cells. Here we fabricated rose bengal (RB)-installed, Tb3+-rich NaYF4 nanocrystals (NaYF4:Tb@RB), in which optically inert Y3+ enables highly efficient energy transfer via high amounts of Tb3+ doping. NaYF4:Tb was prepared via solvothermal synthesis to have an average size of 7.6 nm, followed by coating with poly(maleic anhydride-alt-1-octedecene)-poly(ethylene glycol) with a molecular weight of 2000 (C18PMH-PEG2k). Further, RB was covalently conjugated to carboxyl groups generated from PMH on NaYF4:Tb using an ethylenediamine linker. NaYF4:Tb@RB exhibited a hydrodynamic diameter of &#8764;75 nm with a &#950;-potential of -12 mV. NaYF4:Tb@RB efficiently generated ROS in cultured luciferase-expressing murine epithelial breast cancer (4T1-luc) cells under low dose X-ray irradiation (0.5 Gy). The ROS generation amounts of NaYF4:Tb@RB were 1.5-2-fold higher than those of NaGdF4:Tb@RB, in which host nanocrystals were prepared with optically active Gd3+. Flow cytometric and confocal microscopic analyses showed higher intracellular ROS production of NaYF4:Tb@RB, compared to NaYF4:Tb and RB, resulting in higher X-ray-induced DNA damage in cultured 4T1-luc cells. Ultimately, NaYF4:Tb@RB elicited significant cytotoxicity after X-ray irradiation (0.5 Gy), while inducing marginal cytotoxicity without X-ray irradiation. Altogether, this research proposes a promising ScNP design for efficient X-PDT agents that make the better use of incident X-ray energy while causing the fewest side effects.","query":"cancer"},"36318738":{"ArticleTitle":"Reply to S.

We evaluated the performance of unsupervised clustering for the post-induction assessment of bulk and LSC MRD in 155 AML patients who received intensive conventional chemotherapy treatment. The median overall survival (OS) for Bulk+ MRD patients was 16.7 months and was not reached for negative patients (Hazard Ratio, HR:3.82, p<0.0001). The median OS of LSC+ MRD patients was 25.0 months and not reached for negative patients (HR:2.84, p=0.001).

A silyl ether protection strategy was adopted to make melt polymerizable monomers, which were subjected to solvent free melt polycondensation to produce silyl-protected poly(ester-urethane)s.

In this work, we demonstrate a new strategy to selectively inhibit TrxR through constructing electrophilic center -N-Se(&#948;+)-N- by using the polarization effect of the selenium atom. The constructed electrophilic center interacts noncovalently with the active motif of TrxR to avoid the interference of other residues in human tissues, thereby selectively inhibiting intracellular TrxR activity. Computational and experimental analysis confirms that the formed electrophilic selenium center preferred to attack the SeC residues in the redox active center of TrxR at the 498 site through strong noncovalent interactions.

Women exposed versus not to cigarette smoke early in life had a higher risk of developing ovarian cancer with low levels of T cells overall (CD3+: HR: 1.54, 95%CI: 1.08, 2.20) and recently activated cytotoxic T cells (CD3+CD8+CD69+: HR: 1.45, 95%CI: 1.05, 2.00). These findings were not statistically significant at the Bonferroni corrected p-value of 0.0083. Adult smoking was not significantly associated with tumor immune markers after Bonferroni correction. These results suggest early life cigarette smoke exposure may modestly increase risk of developing ovarian tumors with low abundance of total T cells and recently activated cytotoxic T cells. Future research should focus on understanding the impact of exposures throughout the life course on the ovarian tumor immune microenvironment.","query":"cancer"},"36318650":{"ArticleTitle":"Combination of ribociclib with BET-bromodomain and PI3K\/mTOR inhibitors for medulloblastoma treatment in vitro and in vivo.","AbstractText":"Despite improvement in the treatment of medulloblastoma (MB) over the last years, numerous patients with MYC- and MYCN-driven tumors still fail current therapies. MBs have an intact retinoblastoma protein RB, suggesting that CDK4\/6 inhibition might represent a therapeutic strategy for which drug combination remains understudied. We conducted high throughput drug combination screens in a Group3 (G3) MB line using the CDK4\/6 inhibitor (CDK4\/6i) ribociclib at IC20, referred to as an anchor, and 87 oncology drugs approved by FDA or in clinical trials. Bromodomain and extra terminal (BET) and PI3K\/mTOR inhibitors potentiated ribociclib inhibition of proliferation in an established cell line and freshly dissociated tumor cells from intracranial xenografts of G3 and Sonic hedgehog (SHH) MBs in vitro. A reverse combination screen using the BET inhibitor JQ1 as anchor, revealed CDK4\/6i as the most potentiating drugs. In vivo, ribociclib showed single agent activity in MB models while JQ1 failed to show efficacy due to high clearance and insufficient free brain concentration. Despite in vitro synergy, combination of ribociclib with the PI3K\/mTOR inhibitor paxalisib did not significantly improve the survival of G3 and SHH MB bearing mice compared to ribociclib alone. Molecular analysis of ribociclib and paxalisib treated tumors revealed that E2F targets and PI3K\/AKT\/MTORC1 signaling genes were depleted, as expected. Importantly, in one untreated Group3 medulloblastoma model HD-MB03, the PI3K\/AKT\/MTORC1 gene set was enriched in vitro compared to in vivo suggesting that the pathway displayed increased activity in vitro. Our data illustrate the difficulty in translating in vitro findings in vivo.","query":"cancer"},"36318620":{"ArticleTitle":"Complement-ary immunity to lung cancer.","AbstractText":"Restoring complement signaling in lung cancer enhances the efficacy of immunotherapy in mouse models.","query":"cancer"},"36318612":{"ArticleTitle":"Structure-Activity Relationship Study of Momordica Saponin II Derivatives as Vaccine Adjuvants.","AbstractText":"VSA-2 is a recently developed semisynthetic saponin immunostimulant.

Smoking has been identified as the main contributing cause of the disease's development. The study aimed to identify the key genes in small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the two major types of LC. Meta-analysis was performed with two datasets GSE74706 and GSE149507 obtained from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). Both the datasets comprised samples from cancerous and adjacent non-cancerous tissues. Initially, 633 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified. To understand the underlying molecular mechanism of the identified genes, pathway enrichment, gene ontology (GO) and protein-protein interaction (PPI) analyses were done. A total of 9 hub genes were identified which were subjected to mutation study analysis in LC patients using cBioPortal. These &#160;9 genes (i.e. AURKA, AURKB, KIF23, RACGAP1, KIF2C, KIF20A, CENPE, TPX2 and PRC1) have shown overexpression in LC patients and can be explored as potential candidates for prognostic biomarkers. TPX2 reported a maximum mutation of 4%. This was followed with high throughput screening and docking analysis to identify the potential drug candidates following competitive inhibition of the AURKA-TPX2 complex. Four compounds, CHEMBL431482, CHEMBL2263042, CHEMBL2385714, and CHEMBL1206617 were identified. The results signify that the selected 9 genes can be explored as biomarkers in disease prognosis and targeted therapy. Also, the identified 4 compounds can be further analyzed as promising therapeutic candidates.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

Traditional deep CNNs lead to overfitting when it receives small medical image datasets such as ALLIDB1, ALLIDB2, and ASH. This paper proposes a new and effective model for classifying and detecting Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) or Acute Myelogenous Leukemia (AML) that delivers excellent performance in small medical datasets. Here, we have proposed a novel Orthogonal SoftMax Layer (OSL)-based Acute Leukemia detection model that consists of ResNet 18-based deep feature extraction followed by efficient OSL-based classification. Here, OSL is integrated with the ResNet18 to improve the classification performance by making the weight vectors orthogonal to each other. Hence, it integrates ResNet benefits (residual learning and identity mapping) with the benefits of OSL-based classification (improvement of feature discrimination capability and computational efficiency). Furthermore, we have introduced extra dropout and ReLu layers in the architecture to achieve a faster network with enhanced performance. The performance verification is performed on standard ALLIDB1, ALLIDB2, and C_NMC_2019 datasets for efficient ALL detection and ASH dataset for effective AML detection. The experimental performance demonstrates the superiority of the proposed model over other compairing models.","query":"cancer"},"36318553":{"ArticleTitle":"Classification of Cervical Precursor Lesions via Local Histogram and Cell Morphometric Features.","AbstractText":"Cervical squamous intra-epithelial lesions (SIL) are precursor cancer lesions and their diagnosis is important because patients have a chance to be cured before cancer develops. In the diagnosis of the disease, pathologists decide by considering the cell distribution from the basal to the upper membrane. The idea, inspired by the pathologists' point of view, is based on the fact that cell amounts differ in the basal, central, and upper regions of tissue according to the level of Cervical Intraep- ithelial Neoplasia (CIN). Therefore, histogram information can be used for tissue classification so that the model can be explainable. In this study, two different classification schemes are proposed to show that the local histogram is a useful feature for the classification of cervical tissues. The first classifier is Kullback Leibler divergence-based, and the second one is the classification of the histogram by combining the embedding feature vector from morpho- metric features. These algorithms have been tested on a public dataset.1 The method we propose in the study achieved an accuracy performance of 78.69% in a data set where morphology-based methods were 69.07% and Convo- lutional Neural Network (CNN) patch-based algorithms were 75.77%.

We used VigiBase, the World Health Organization pharmacovigilance database, to identify cardiac ADRs (cADRs), such as carditis, heart failure, arrhythmia, myocardial infarction, and valvular dysfunction, related to ICI therapy. To explore possible relationships, we used the reporting odds ratio (ROR) as a proxy of relative risk. A lower bound of a 95% confidence interval of ROR > 1 reflects a disproportionality signal that more ADRs are observed than expected due to chance. We found 2278 cADR for ICI monotherapy and 353 for ICI combination therapy. Combination therapy was associated with significantly higher odds of carditis (ROR 6.9, 95% CI: 5.6-8.3) versus ICI monotherapy (ROR 5.0, 95% CI: 4.6-5.4). Carditis in ICI combination therapy was fatal in 23.4% of reported ADRs, compared to 15.8% for ICI monotherapy (P = 0.058). Using validated pharmacovigilance methodology, we found increased odds of carditis for all ICI therapies, with the highest odds for combination therapy. Given the substantial risk of severe ADR and death, clinicians should consider these findings when prescribing checkpoint inhibitors.","query":"cancer"},"36318530":{"ArticleTitle":"Gynecologic problems and healthcare behavior by shift patterns in Korean nursing staff.","AbstractText":"We aimed to evaluate the clinical impact of shift patterns at work on gynecologic problems and the healthcare behavior of Korean nursing staff.

Nevertheless, the simultaneous detection of multiple nucleic acids within one assay using the CRISPR-Cas system is still challenging. In this study, we develop an AND logic-gate-based CRISPR-Cas12a biosensing platform to achieve the sensitive colorimetric detection of dual miRNAs. Specifically, the DNA probe was designed to recognize the binary input of miRNAs and to output trigger DNA, which activated the CRISPR-Cas12a system to cut single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). The ssDNA on magnetic beads (MBs) was cleaved by the activated CRISPR-Cas12a, causing the separation of glucose oxidase (GOx) from MB and the subsequent generation of a colorimetric signal. The color change induced by 1 pM of target miRNAs can be directly distinguished by the naked eye and the instrumental limit of detection reaches 36.4 fM. The overexpressed miR-205 and miR-944 in the real human serum can be detected, allowing us to differentiate between lung cancer patients and healthy people. Furthermore, the developed strategy achieves simultaneous detection of dual miRNAs using CRISPR-Cas12a with one kind of crRNA, avoiding sophisticated nucleic acid amplifications and the use of bulky instruments. The current method can broaden the CRISPR-Cas12a-based applications for multiple biomarkers detection and precise disease diagnosis.","query":"cancer"},"36318503":{"ArticleTitle":"Muscle Strength and Power in People With Parkinson Disease: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.","AbstractText":"No studies have synthesized the literature regarding mechanical muscle function (ie, strength, power, rate of force development [RFD]) in people with Parkinson disease (PD).

Mutations in INM proteins interfering with these interactions result in disease. However, mechanisms controlling the levels and turnover of INM proteins remain unknown. Here, we describe a mechanism of regulated degradation of the INM SUN domain-containing protein 2 (SUN2). We show that Casein Kinase II and the C-terminal domain Nuclear Envelope Phosphatase 1 (CTDNEP1) have opposing effects on SUN2 levels by regulating SUN2 binding to the ubiquitin ligase Skp\/Cullin1\/F-Box&#946;TrCP (SCF&#946;TrCP). Upon binding to phosphorylated SUN2, SCF&#946;TrCP promotes its ubiquitination. Ubiquitinated SUN2 is membrane extracted by the AAA ATPase p97 and delivered to the proteasome for degradation. Importantly, accumulation of non-degradable SUN2 results in aberrant nuclear architecture, vulnerability to DNA damage and increased lagging chromosomes in mitosis. These findings uncover a central role of proteolysis in INM protein homeostasis.","query":"cancer"},"36318444":{"ArticleTitle":"Integrative review of school integration support following pediatric cancer.","AbstractText":"This study aims to understand parents' experiences of school integration support for their child's transition to K-12 schooling during or after cancer treatment.

The molecular subtype affects therapy options because it is a complex disorder with multiple subtypes. By concentrating on receptor activation, mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) can be employed as a therapeutic target. The goal of this work was to screen a number of inhibitors produced from Hibiscus rosa-sinensis for possible target to inhibit the mTOR and to determine which has the greatest affinity for the receptor. Primarily, the ionization states of the chosen compounds were predicted using the ChemAxon web platform, and their pKa values were estimated. Given the significance of interactions between proteins in the development of drugs, structure-based virtual screening was done using AutoDock Vina. Approximately 120 Hibiscus components and ten approved anti-cancer drugs, including the mTOR inhibitor everolimus, were used in the comparative analysis. By using Lipinski's rule of five to the chosen compounds, the ADMET profile and drug-likeness characteristics were further examined to assess the anti-breast cancer activity. The compounds with the highest ranked binding poses were loaded using the SeeSAR tool and the HYDE scoring to give interactive, desolvation, and visual &#916;G estimation for ligand binding affinity assessment. Following, the prospective candidates underwent three replicas of 100&#160;ns long molecular dynamics simulations, preceded with MM-GBSA binding free energy calculation. The stability of the protein-ligand complex was determined using root mean square deviation (RMSD), root mean square fluctuation (RMSF), and protein-ligand interactions. The results demonstrated that the best mTOR binding affinities were found for stigmastadienol (107), lupeol (66), and taraxasterol acetate (111), which all performed well in comparison to the control compounds.

Checkpoint inhibitors targeting the PD-1\/PD-L1 axis as monotherapy in metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (mTNBC) have a limited role due to low response rates, but are capable of long, durable responses. Combination PARP inhibition with checkpoint blockade is an emerging area of investigation with potential synergy to produce robust responses with durability. Mechanistically, PARP inhibition activates the stimulator of interferon gene (STING) pathway to promote dendritic cell and T lymphocyte recruitment, increases tumor neoantigens, and upregulates PD-L1 expression to increase the immunogenicity of the tumor and thereby potentially enhance responses to immunotherapy. Several clinical trials have reported early results on PARP inhibitor and PD-1\/PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitor combinations. All studies have shown safety and tolerability of this combination regimen. In advanced breast cancer associated with a germline BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation, response rates have been high and similar to what is observed with PARP inhibitor monotherapy. Additional follow-up is needed to see if combination with a checkpoint inhibitor can lead to a clinically meaningful extension of durability of response in patients with germline mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2. In unselected mTNBC in the 1st-3rd line setting, response rates of combined PARP inhibitor and PD-1\/PD-L1 inhibitors have ranged from 18-21%, with higher rates of response among those with alterations in homologous recombination DNA repair pathway genes. Multiple ongoing studies will report additional data on combinations of PARP inhibitors and checkpoint blockade in the future and this combination strategy remains an active area of investigation.","query":"cancer"},"36318379":{"ArticleTitle":"Pre-existing, Concurrent\/Early-Onset, and Late-Onset Diabetes in Chronic Pancreatitis: Do Outcomes Differ?","AbstractText":"Diabetes secondary to endocrine insufficiency in chronic pancreatitis (CP) may develop at any time during the&#160;disease course. We sought to evaluate the differences in clinical characteristics and outcomes in CP patients with pre-existing, early-onset, and late-onset diabetes. We reviewed CP patients seen at our Pancreas Center during 2016-2021. We divided them into four groups: those without diabetes, with pre-existing diabetes, with early-onset diabetes, and with late-onset diabetes. We then compared&#160;clinical characteristics and outcomes. We identified 450 patients with CP: 271 without diabetes, 99 with pre-existing diabetes, 51 with early-onset diabetes, and 29 with late-onset diabetes. Early-onset diabetics&#160;were younger (54.1 vs 57.3 vs 62.5 vs 61.9&#160;years), had more alcohol-related CP (45.1% vs 31.7% vs 32.3% vs 31%), had higher HbA1C levels (8.02% vs 5.11% vs 7.71% vs 7.66%), were more likely to be on insulin (78.4% vs 0% vs 48.4% vs 65.5%), and used more opioids (64.7% vs 43.9% vs 55.1% vs 44.8%) and gabapentinoids (66.7% vs 43.5% vs 48% vs 60.7%) compared to other groups (p&#8201;<&#8201;0.05).

It plays a key role in embryogenesis and cell proliferation and has been strongly linked to various solid tumors. We sought to understand the regulation of FOXM1 in colorectal cancer (CRC), as well as if and to what extent other clinicopathological characteristics are associated with FOXM1. The investigation comprised 98 CRC samples and normal tissues (controls). All colon cancer patients had a colonoscopy and targeted biopsy. All rectal cancer patients had a CT and MRI. Real-time PCR, Immunohistochemistry, and Western blotting were used to evaluate FOXM1 expression, and the findings were analyzed using SPSS (v.26). FOXM1 mRNA and protein expression were substantially upregulated in tumor tissues, with the majority of these proteins localized in nucleo-cytoplasm. Elevated protein levels of FOXM1 were strongly correlated with lower education level, larger tumor size, lymph node status, lymphovascular invasion (LVI), perineural invasion (PNI), lymph node metastasis (LNM), tumor invasion depth (subserosal and serosal invasion), late stage (III and IV), localization (nucleo-cytoplasmic), intensity (strong) and recurrence. Based on survival analysis, FOXM1 overexpression and nucleo-cytoplasmic localization were associated with shorter disease-free survival while stage and PNI were linked to poorer overall and disease-free survival. According to the results of the Cox regression analysis, stage and PNI were significant predictors of prognosis in CRC patients. FOXM1 expression was elevated in CRC and was linked to reduced disease-free survival. These findings support prior reports and hence FOXM1 can be an important prognostic marker for CRC and a promising therapeutic target. Additionally, we found a link between poor disease-free survival and FOXM1's nucleo-cytoplasmic localization. However, since the sample size of this study was small, further research is needed to validate our findings.","query":"cancer"},"36318367":{"ArticleTitle":"BAP1 in cancer: epigenetic stability and genome integrity.","AbstractText":"Mutations in BAP1 have been identified in a hereditary cancer predisposition syndrome and in sporadic tumours. Individuals carrying familiar BAP1 monoallelic mutations display hypersusceptibility to exposure-associated cancers, such as asbestos-driven mesothelioma, thus BAP1 status has been postulated to participate in gene-environment interaction. Intriguingly, BAP1 functions display also a high degree of tissue dependency, associated to a peculiar cancer spectrum and cell types of specific functions. Mechanistically, BAP1 functions as an ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase (UCH) and controls regulatory ubiquitination of histones as well as degradative ubiquitination of a range of protein substrates. In this article we provide an overview of the most relevant findings on BAP1, underpinning its tissue specific tumour suppressor function. We also discuss the importance of its epigenetic role versus the control of protein stability in the regulation of genomic integrity.","query":"cancer"},"36318364":{"ArticleTitle":"Epidemiology and Treatment Patterns of Venous Thromboembolism: an Observational Study of Nationwide Time-Series Trends in Japan.","AbstractText":"Previous studies on anticoagulation treatment trends have mostly focused on hospitalized patients. This study aimed to clarify the treatment status of patients with venous thromboembolism (VTE) in Japan from 2011 to 2018, including outpatients, and to assess adherence with current guidelines. Data of inpatients and outpatients who were treated for VTE were extracted from a nationwide claims database (Medical Data Vision Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) and analyzed. The study included 79,330 patients with VTE; half were diagnosed during hospitalization for diseases other than VTE. The proportion of outpatient treatment increased significantly from 2015 to 2018 (Cochran-Armitage trend test, P&#8201;<&#8201;0.0001), while 80% were anticoagulated in hospital after pulmonary embolism (PE) diagnosis. The proportion of patients with VTE treated as outpatients was no lower than the proportion of inpatients, even in the presence of active cancer, and there were no clear differences in anticoagulant choices. Treatment with direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) did not always include the recommended initial intensification therapy. There was wide variation in the duration of DOAC treatment and the median duration of use was shorter than that recommended in VTE treatment guidelines. While the gradual increase in VTE outpatient treatment appears to be in line with guideline recommendations, PE outpatient treatment could be further facilitated. The large proportion of patients diagnosed with VTE during hospitalization for other conditions suggests the importance of further utilizing in-hospital manuals for thrombosis prevention. The presence or absence of cancer did not appear to affect the basic treatment strategy of anticoagulation for VTE. Future studies are expected to better define the characteristics of patients who can be safely and effectively treated in an outpatient setting, and to examine whether anticoagulation for a shorter treatment period than recommended by the guidelines or DOAC therapy without initial intensification would improve patient outcomes.","query":"cancer"},"36318362":{"ArticleTitle":"Outcome of patients with differentiated thyroid cancer treated with empirical radioiodine therapy on the basis of Thyroglobulin Elevation Negative Iodine Scintigraphy (TENIS) syndrome without structural disease: a retrospective cohort study.","AbstractText":"For differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) patients with thyroglobulin (Tg) elevation and negative iodine scintigraphy (commonly termed \"TENIS\" syndrome) after thyroidectomy, radioactive iodine (RAI) therapy, and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) suppression therapy, empirical RAI therapy may be considered. However, the outcome data of TENIS syndrome without structural disease after empirical RAI therapy have not shown clear evidence of improvement in survival.

Emerging evidence indicates the therapeutic potential of A. muciniphila for NAFLD, especially in the inflammatory stage, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Here, the current knowledge on the role of A. muciniphila in the progression of NAFLD was summarized. A. muciniphila abundancy is decreased in animals and humans with NAFLD. The recovery of A. muciniphila presented benefits in preventing hepatic fat accumulation and inflammation in NAFLD. The details of how microbes regulate hepatic immunity and lipid accumulation in NAFLD were further discussed. The modulation mechanisms by which A. muciniphila acts to improve hepatic inflammation are mainly attributed to the alleviation of inflammatory cytokines and LPS signals and the downregulation of microbiota-related innate immune cells (such as macrophages). This review provides insights into the roles of A. muciniphila in NAFLD, thereby providing a blueprint to facilitate clinical therapeutic applications.","query":"cancer"},"36318342":{"ArticleTitle":"Risk factors for cancer-related fatigue in patients with colorectal cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.","AbstractText":"Cancer-related fatigue seriously affects the quality of life of cancer patients, yet few systematic reviews have evaluated the risk factors for cancer-related fatigue in patients with colorectal cancer.

From April 2018 to November 2021, patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC who underwent cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) sampling under the clinical suspicion of LM were enrolled. The patients' clinicodemographic characteristics, treatment history including whole-brain radiation therapy (WBRT), overall survival (OS), and intracranial progression-free survival (icPFS) were measured. EGFR mutations in cell-free tumor DNA (ctDNA) of CSF, including T790M mutation, were analyzed. We enrolled 62 patients with NSCLC. The median time form diagnosis to LM was 23.1&#160;months and 16 (25.8%) patients had history of prior third-generation EGFR-TKI use. EGFR mutation in CSF ctDNA was detected in 53 patients (85.5%); of them, 10 (16.1%) had T790M mutation. The patients' icPFS and OS after osimertinib were 6.43 and 9.37&#160;months, respectively, and were comparable among patients with different sensitive EGFR mutations, indicating that EGFR mutation status did not affect osimertinib efficacy. Patients who received WBRT after LM had numerically higher icPFS and OS compared to those without. Multivariate analysis revealed that lack of prior exposure to third-generation EGFR-TKI was associated with better OS. Osimertinib is effective in patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC who developed LM and prior third-generation EGFR-TKI use was associated with poor survival in these patients. The role of WBRT warrants further investigation.","query":"cancer"},"36318331":{"ArticleTitle":"Comparison of PSA density and lesion volume strategies for selecting men with equivocal PI-RADS 3 lesions on bpMRI for biopsies.","AbstractText":"To compare two strategies: Prostate-specific antigen density (PSAd) and lesion volume measurement in ruling out significant prostate cancer (sPCa) in men with equivocal Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) category 3 index lesions on biparametric magnetic resonance imaging.

We also show how the individual metabolomic fingerprint at the onset of a disease may discriminate responders from non-responders to a given drug, or how it may be prognostic of e.g., cancer recurrence after many years. In parallel with fingerprinting, profiling (i.e., the identification and quantification of many metabolites and, in the case of selected biofluids, of the lipoprotein components that contribute to the 1H NMR spectral features) can provide hints on the metabolic pathways that are altered by a disease and assess their restoration after treatment.","query":"cancer"},"36318314":{"ArticleTitle":"Negative multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging for prostate cancer: further outcome and consequences.","AbstractText":"EAU guidelines recommend multiparametric MRI of the prostate (mpMRI) prior to biopsy to increase accuracy and reduce biopsies.

Future studies should investigate the effect of individual supplements, particularly NVNM supplements, on improving other cancer-related outcomes.","query":"cancer"},"36318267":{"ArticleTitle":"Estrogen regulates divergent transcriptional and epigenetic cell states in breast cancer.","AbstractText":"Breast cancers are known to be driven by the transcription factor estrogen receptor and its ligand estrogen. While the receptor's cis-binding elements are known to vary between tumors, heterogeneity of hormone signaling at a single-cell level is unknown. In this study, we systematically tracked estrogen response across time at a single-cell level in multiple cell line and organoid models. To accurately model these changes, we developed a computational tool (TITAN) that quantifies signaling gradients in single-cell datasets. Using this approach, we found that gene expression response to estrogen is non-uniform, with distinct cell groups expressing divergent transcriptional networks. Pathway analysis suggested the two most distinct signatures are driven separately by ER and FOXM1. We observed that FOXM1 was indeed activated by phosphorylation upon estrogen stimulation and silencing of FOXM1 attenuated the relevant gene signature. Analysis of scRNA-seq data from patient samples confirmed the existence of these divergent cell groups, with the FOXM1 signature predominantly found in ER negative cells. Further, multi-omic single-cell experiments indicated that the different cell groups have distinct chromatin accessibility states. Our results provide a comprehensive insight into ER biology at the single-cell level and potential therapeutic strategies to mitigate resistance to therapy.","query":"cancer"},"36318262":{"ArticleTitle":"Hyaline Cartilage Microtissues Engineered from Adult Dedifferentiated Chondrocytes: Safety and Role of WNT Signaling.","AbstractText":"The repair of damaged articular cartilage is an unmet medical need. Chondrocyte-based cell therapy has been used to repair cartilage for over 20 years despite current limitations. Chondrocyte dedifferentiation upon expansion in monolayer is well known and is the main obstacle to their use as cell source for cartilage repair. Consequently, current approaches often lead to fibrocartilage, which is biomechanically different from hyaline cartilage and not effective as a long-lasting treatment. Here, we describe an innovative 3-step method to engineer hyaline-like cartilage microtissues, named Cartibeads, from high passage dedifferentiated chondrocytes. We show that WNT5A\/5B\/7B genes were highly expressed in dedifferentiated chondrocytes and that a decrease of the WNT signaling pathway was instrumental for full re-differentiation of chondrocytes, enabling production of hyaline matrix instead of fibrocartilage matrix. Cartibeads showed hyaline-like characteristics based on GAG quantity and type II collagen expression independently of donor age and cartilage quality. In vivo, Cartibeads were not tumorigenic when transplanted into SCID mice. This simple 3-step method allowed a standardized production of hyaline-like cartilage microtissues from a small cartilage sample, making Cartibeads a promising candidate for the treatment of cartilage lesions.","query":"cancer"},"36318256":{"ArticleTitle":"CRdb: a comprehensive resource for deciphering chromatin regulators in human.","AbstractText":"Chromatin regulators (CRs) regulate epigenetic patterns on a partial or global scale, playing a critical role in affecting multi-target gene expression. As chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) data associated with CRs are rapidly accumulating, a comprehensive resource of CRs needs to be built urgently for collecting, integrating, and processing these data, which can provide abundant annotated information on CR upstream and downstream regulatory analyses as well as CR-related analysis functions. This study established an integrative CR resource, named CRdb (http:\/\/cr.liclab.net\/crdb\/), with the aim of curating a large number of available resources for CRs and providing extensive annotations and analyses of CRs to help biological researchers clarify the regulation mechanism and function of CRs. The CRdb database comprised a total of 647 CRs and 2,591 ChIP-seq samples from more than 300 human tissues and cell types. These samples have been manually curated from NCBI GEO\/SRA and ENCODE. Importantly, CRdb provided the abundant and detailed genetic annotations in CR-binding regions based on ChIP-seq. Furthermore, CRdb supported various functional annotations and upstream regulatory information on CRs. In particular, it embedded four types of CR regulatory analyses: CR gene set enrichment, CR-binding genomic region annotation, CR-TF co-occupancy analysis, and CR regulatory axis analysis. CRdb is a useful and powerful resource that can help in exploring the potential functions of CRs and their regulatory mechanism in diseases and biological processes.","query":"cancer"},"36318242":{"ArticleTitle":"ASCancer Atlas: a comprehensive knowledgebase of alternative splicing in human cancers.","AbstractText":"Alternative splicing (AS) is a fundamental process that governs almost all aspects of cellular functions, and dysregulation in this process has been implicated in tumor initiation, progression and treatment resistance.

However, a resource of key functional AS events in human cancers is still lacking. To fill the gap, we developed ASCancer Atlas (https:\/\/ngdc.cncb.ac.cn\/ascancer), a comprehensive knowledgebase of aberrant splicing in human cancers.

For each event, we manually curated the functional axis including upstream splicing regulators, splicing event annotations, downstream oncogenic effects, and possible therapeutic strategies. ASCancer Atlas also houses about 2 million computationally putative splicing events. Additionally, a user-friendly web interface was built to enable users to easily browse, search, visualize, analyze, and download all splicing events.

Two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) radiomics features were extracted from portal venous Phase CT images. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator algorithm and logistic regression were used for constructing 2D and 3D radiomics models. The radiomics nomogram was developed by integrating the rad-score and the clinical risk factor. The rad-score was significantly higher in the LVI + group than in the LVI- group (p < 0.05). The AUC, accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of the 3D radiomics model were higher than those of the 2D radiomics model. The AUCs of 3D and 2D radiomics models in the training set were 0.82 (95% CI: 0.75-0.89) and 0.74 (95% CI: 0.66-0.82); in the internal validation set were 0.75 (95% CI: 0.65-0.85) and 0.67 (95% CI: 0.56-0.78); in the external validation set were 0.75 (95% CI: 0.64-0.86) and 0.57 (95% CI: 0.45-0.69); respectively. The AUCs of the nomogram integrating the optimal 3D rad-score and clinical risk factors (CT-reported T stage, CT-reported lymph node status) in the internal set and external validation set were 0.82 (95% CI: 0.73-0.91) and 0.80 (95% CI: 0.68-0.91), respectively. Both 2D and 3D radiomics models can predict LVI status of CRC. The nomogram combining the optimal 3D rad-score and clinical risk factors further improved predictive performance. This is the first study to compare the difference in performance of CT-based 2D and 3D radiomics models for the preoperative prediction of LVI in CRC. The prediction of the nomogram could be improved by combining the 3D radiomics model with the imaging model, suggesting its potential for clinical application.","query":"cancer"},"36318237":{"ArticleTitle":"Multimodal locoregional procedures for cancer pain management: a literature review.","AbstractText":"Pain is the most common and fearsome symptom in cancer patients, particularly in the advanced stage of disease.

Therefore, simultaneous monitoring of multiplexed miRNA in biological samples can not only improve the accuracy and specificity of bioassays but also avoid the squandering of valuable biological specimens. Herein, we designed a metal sulfide nanoparticle-based dual barcode-triggered DNAzyme cascade strategy for the sensitive and simultaneous multiplex miRNA detection in a single assay. Firstly, the capture probes (H1, H2) specifically recognize targets (miRNA-21, miRNA-141), exposing the stem of H1 and H2. Then, with the introduction of a detection probe (CuS-H3, ZnS-H4), the exposed H1 and H2 catalyze the hairpin assembly (CHA) reaction, realizing target miRNA recycling, and forming H1\/H3-CuS and H2\/H4-ZnS complexes. Subsequently, the formed H1\/H3-CuS and H2\/H4-ZnS complexes are encoded on magnetic beads through the biotin\/streptavidin interaction. The CuS and ZnS nanoparticles captured by magnetic beads release thousands of Cu2+ and Zn2+via the cation exchange reaction. Finally, the released Cu2+ and Zn2+ specially activate the DNAzyme of the catalytic and molecular beacon (CAMB) system. The CAMB system affords an amplified fluorescence signal output by cycling and regenerating the metal ion-dependent DNAzyme to realize multiple enzymatic turnovers. Benefiting from target recycling, nanoparticle amplification, and catalytic and molecular beacon amplification, there is substantial amplification and the target miRNAs can be detected at 0.06 fM (miRNA-21) and 0.048 fM (miRNA-141) in a single assay. Furthermore, the high selectivity and accuracy of the assay were proved by practical analysis of different cancer cells, which exhibited good practicability in multiplex miRNA detection in clinical sera. The results indicate that the proposed strategy holds great potential for the sensitive detection of multiplex cancer biomarkers and offers the opportunity for future applications in clinical diagnosis.","query":"cancer"},"36318208":{"ArticleTitle":"Association of Hormone Therapy With Depression During Menopause in a Cohort of Danish Women.","AbstractText":"During menopause, the levels of estrogen and progesterone decrease and 60% to 70% of women experience menopausal symptoms, including mood disturbances. The latter might be prevented by hormone therapy (HT), yet some studies have suggested that use of HT might be associated with increased risk of depression. To examine whether use of HT during menopause was associated with a subsequent diagnosis of depression. This nationwide register-based cohort and self-controlled case series study included all women in Denmark aged 45 years between January 1, 1995, through December 31, 2017 (n&#8201;=&#8201;825 238), without prior oophorectomy, breast cancer, or cancer in reproductive organs. Follow-up was completed on December 31, 2018. The statistical analysis was performed from September 1, 2021, through May 31, 2022. Redeemed prescriptions of different types of HT identified by the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical classification system codes (G03C [estrogen] and G03F [estrogen combined with progestin]) in the Danish National Prescription Registry between 1995 and 2017. Type of administration was divided into systemic (oral or transdermal) and local (intravaginal or intrauterine). A hospital diagnosis of depression (International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision, codes F32-F33 and International Classification of Diseases, Eighth Revision, codes 296.09, 296.29, 298.0, and 300.49) between 1995 through 2018. Associations were examined in cohort and self-controlled case series analysis using Cox proportional hazards and fixed-effects Poisson regression models. During follow-up from 45 years of age to a mean of 56.0 (range, 45.1-67.7) years, 189 821 women (23.0%) initiated systemically or locally administered HT and 13&#8239;069 (1.6%) were diagnosed with depression. Systemically administered HT was mainly initiated before 50 years of age and was associated with a higher risk of a subsequent depression diagnosis (hazard ratio [HR] for 48-50 years of age, 1.50 [95% CI, 1.24-1.81]). The risk was especially elevated the year after initiation of both treatment with estrogen alone (HR, 2.03 [95% CI, 1.21-3.41]) and estrogen combined with progestin (HR, 2.01 [95% CI,1.26-3.21]). Locally administered HT was initiated across all ages and was not associated with depression risk (HR, 1.15 [95% CI, 0.70-1.87]). It was, however, associated with a lower risk of depression when initiated after 54 years of age (HR for 54-60 years of age, 0.80 [95% CI, 0.70-0.91]). In self-controlled analysis, which efficiently accounts for time-invariant confounding, users of systemically administered HT had higher rates of depression in the years after initiation compared with the years before treatment (incidence rate ratio for 0-1 year after initiation, 1.66 [95% CI, 1.30-2.14]). These findings suggest that systemically administered HT before and during menopause is associated with higher risk of depression, especially in the years immediately after initiation, whereas locally administered HT is associated with lower risk of depression for women 54 years or older.","query":"cancer"},"36318206":{"ArticleTitle":"Perspectives of Academic Oncologists About Offering Expanded Access to Investigational Drugs.","AbstractText":"The expanded access (EA) pathway permits patients to be treated with investigational medical products outside clinical trials.

To learn how oncologists practicing at academic medical centers (AMCs) perceive EA and their role in offering it. This qualitative study used data from semistructured interviews conducted from February 2020 to September 2021 with a purposive sample of oncologists recruited from large, urban AMCs in the northeast United States. Oncologists who had submitted at least 1 single-patient EA request to the institutional review boards at the University of Pennsylvania, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, NYU Langone Health, and Dana-Farber Cancer Institute from January 1, 2014, through January 31, 2020, were eligible to participate. Data were analyzed from July 2021 to March 2022. Interviews focused on oncologist practice demographics, experience with EA, factors relevant to decisions to pursue EA and comfort with those decisions, perspectives on oncologists' role in EA, perspectives on the FDA's role, and the Right to Try pathway to access investigational drugs. Eligible oncologists were interviewed until thematic saturation was reached, resulting in 25 interviews; most participants were women (15 participants [60%]), reported primarily treating adult patients (15 participants [60%]), had more than 10 years of clinical experience (16 participants [64%]), and had submitted at least 2 single-patient EA requests to their institutional review boards during the relevant period (14 participants [56%]). Oncologists viewed EA as an important tool for securing what they determined to be the best treatment option for their patients based on their own expert assessment of available data. Interviewees reported that they would rather access interventions as commercially available products or through clinical trials; however, if the preferred option was not available through these means, they viewed pursuit of EA as part of their obligation to patients, while often recognizing the potential for inequities in the broader patient population beyond their institutions. Participating oncologists felt confident pursuing investigational drugs for treatment use, despite the absence of FDA marketing approval, and did not necessarily view EA as a last resort. These findings indicate that oncologists practicing in large academic settings sought to treat patients with the interventions they deemed most likely to be beneficial, regardless of approval status. As such, they viewed EA as an unexceptional means to obtain promising products, although it remains unclear whether their confidence in evaluating investigational treatments was justified. Future research should examine whether oncologists outside large AMCs share this confidence, as differences may influence patient access to the EA treatment pathway.","query":"cancer"},"36318182":{"ArticleTitle":"Zonal Intratumoral Delivery of Nanoparticles Guided by Surface Functionalization.","AbstractText":"Delivery of small molecules and anticancer agents to malignant cells or specific regions within a tumor is limited by penetration depth and poor spatial drug distribution, hindering anticancer efficacy. Herein, we demonstrate control over gold nanoparticle (GNP) penetration and spatial distribution across solid tumors by administering GNPs with different surface chemistries at a constant injection rate via syringe pump. A key finding in this study is the discovery of different zone-specific accumulation patterns of intratumorally injected nanoparticles dependent on surface functionalization. Computed tomography (CT) imaging performed in vivo of C57BL\/6 mice harboring Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) tumors on their flank and gross visualization of excised tumors consistently revealed that intratumorally administered citrate-GNPs accumulate in particle clusters in central areas of the tumor, while GNPs functionalized with thiolated phosphothioethanol (PTE-GNPs) and thiolated polyethylene glycol (PEG-GNPs) regularly accumulate in the tumor periphery. Further, PEG functionalization resulted in larger tumoral surface coverage than PTE, reaching beyond the outer zone of the tumor mass and into the surrounding stroma. To understand the dissimilarities in spatiotemporal evolution across the different GNP surface chemistries, we modeled their intratumoral transport with reaction-diffusion equations. Our results suggest that GNP surface passivation affects nanoparticle reactivity with the tumor microenvironment, leading to differential transport behavior across tumor zones. The present study provides a mechanistic understanding of the factors affecting spatiotemporal distribution of nanoparticles in the tumor. Our proof of concept of zonal delivery within the tumor may prove useful for directing anticancer therapies to regions of biomarker overexpression.","query":"cancer"},"36318178":{"ArticleTitle":"Cancer Prevention from the Viewpoint of UVA Comprehensive Cancer Center.","AbstractText":"Prevention is a cornerstone of the guiding mission of the University of Virginia Comprehensive Cancer Center, which is \"to reduce the burden of cancer for the patients of today, through skilled, integrated, and compassionate care and to eliminate the threat of cancer for the patients of tomorrow, through research and education in an environment that promotes diversity, equity, and inclusion.\" We find it useful to conceptualize different opportunities for cancer prevention using NCI's Health Behaviors Research Branch's multilevel translational framework.

Therefore, it is essential to distinguish benign from malignant adenomas in the early screening of colorectal cancer. Many deep learning computational pathology studies based on whole slide images (WSIs) have been proposed. Most approaches require manual annotation of lesion regions on WSIs, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive. This study proposes a new approach MIST - Multiple Instance learning network based on Swin Transformer, which can accurately classify colorectal adenoma WSIs only with slide-level labels. MIST uses Swin Transformer as the backbone to extract features of images through self-supervised contrastive learning and uses a dual-stream multiple instance learning network to predict the class of slides. We trained and validated MIST on 666 WSIs collected from 480 colorectal adenoma patients in the Department of Pathology, the Affiliated Drum Tower Hospital of Nanjing University Medical School. These slides contained six common types of colorectal adenomas. The accuracy of external validation on 273 newly-collected WSIs from Nanjing First Hospital was 0.784, which was superior to the existing methods and reached a level comparable to that of the local pathologist's accuracy of 0.806. Finally, we analyzed the interpretability of MIST and observed that the lesion areas of interest in MIST were generally consistent with local pathologists. In conclusion, MIST is a low-burden, interpretable and effective approach that can be used in colorectal cancer screening and potential reduction of the mortality of CRC patients by assisting clinicians in the decision-making process.

Perimenopause, or the menopausal transition, is the few-year time period preceding a person's final menstrual period and is characterized by increasing menstrual cycle length variability and periods of amenorrhea, and often symptoms such as vasomotor dysfunction. The prevalence and incidence of most chronic diseases (eg, cardiovascular disease, cancer, osteoporosis, and fracture) increase with age, and US persons who reach menopause are expected on average to live more than another 30 years. To update its 2017 recommendation, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) commissioned a systematic review to evaluate the benefits and harms of systemic (ie, oral or transdermal) hormone therapy for the prevention of chronic conditions in postmenopausal persons and whether outcomes vary by age or by timing of intervention after menopause.

According to Warburg himself, the consequence of the Warburg effect is cell dedifferentiation. Therefore, reversing the Warburg effect might be an approach to restore cell differentiation in cancer. In this study, we used a mitochondrial uncoupler, niclosamide ethanolamine (NEN), to activate mitochondrial respiration, which induced neural differentiation in neuroblastoma cells. NEN treatment increased the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)+\/NADH and pyruvate\/lactate ratios and also the &#945;-ketoglutarate (&#945;-KG)\/2- hydroxyglutarate (2-HG) ratio. Consequently, NEN treatment induced promoter CpG island demethylation and epigenetic landscape remodeling, activating the neural differentiation program. In addition, NEN treatment upregulated p53 but downregulated N-Myc and &#946;-catenin signaling in neuroblastoma cells. Importantly, even under hypoxia, NEN treatment remained effective in inhibiting 2-HG generation, promoting DNA demethylation, and suppressing hypoxia-inducible factor signaling. Dietary NEN intervention reduced tumor growth rate, 2-HG levels, and expression of N-Myc and &#946;-catenin in tumors in an orthotopic neuroblastoma mouse model. Integrative analysis indicated that NEN treatment upregulated favorable prognosis genes and downregulated unfavorable prognosis genes, which were defined using multiple neuroblastoma patient datasets. Altogether, these results suggest that mitochondrial uncoupling is an effective metabolic and epigenetic therapy for reversing the Warburg effect and inducing differentiation in neuroblastoma.","query":"cancer"},"36318117":{"ArticleTitle":"Gene fusion detection and characterization in long-read cancer transcriptome sequencing data with FusionSeeker.","AbstractText":"Gene fusions are prevalent in a wide array of cancer types with different frequencies. Long-read transcriptome sequencing technologies, such as PacBio, Iso-Seq, and Nanopore direct RNA sequencing, provide full-length transcript sequencing reads, which could facilitate detection of gene fusions. In this work, we developed a method, FusionSeeker, to comprehensively characterize gene fusions in long-read cancer transcriptome data and reconstruct accurate fused transcripts from raw reads. FusionSeeker identified gene fusions in both exonic and intronic regions, allowing comprehensive characterization of gene fusions in cancer transcriptomes. Fused transcript sequences were reconstructed with FusionSeeker by correcting sequencing errors in the raw reads through partial order alignment algorithm. Using these accurate transcript sequences, FusionSeeker refined gene fusion breakpoint positions and predicted breakpoints at single basepair resolution. Overall, FusionSeeker will enable users to discover gene fusions accurately using long-read data, which can facilitate downstream functional analysis as well as improved cancer diagnosis and treatment.","query":"cancer"},"36318113":{"ArticleTitle":"DOT1L Regulates Ovarian Cancer Stem Cells by Activating &#946;-catenin Signaling.","AbstractText":"Cancer stem cells (CSC) represent a population of cancer cells responsible for tumor initiation, chemoresistance and metastasis. Here we identified the H3K79 methyltransferase disruptor of telomeric silencing-1-like (DOT1L) as a critical regulator of self-renewal and tumor initiation in ovarian CSCs. DOT1L was upregulated in ovarian CSCs vs. non-CSCs. shRNA-mediated DOT1L knockdown decreased the aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) + cell population, impaired the tumor initiation capacity of ovarian CSCs, and blocked the expression of stemness-associated genes. Inhibition of DOT1L's methyltransferase activity by the small molecule inhibitor (DOT1Li) EPZ-5676 also effectively targeted ovarian CSCs. Integrated RNA-sequencing analyses of ovarian cancer (OC) cells in which DOT1L was knocked down vs. control cells and of ovarian CSCs vs. non-CSCs, identified Wnt signaling as a shared pathway deregulated in both CSCs and in DOT1L-deficient OC cells. &#946;-catenin, a key transcription factor regulated by Wnt, was downregulated in OC cells in which DOT1L was knocked down and upregulated in DOT1L overexpressing OC cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) revealed enrichment of the H3K79Me3 mark at the &#946;-catenin promoter, suggesting that its transcription is regulated by DOT1L. Our results suggest that DOT1L is critical for the self-renewal and tumor initiation capacity (TIC) of ovarian CSCs by regulating &#946;-catenin signaling. Targeting DOT1L in OC could be a new strategy to eliminate CSCs. Implications: This study found that the histone methyltransferase DOT1L regulates the self-renewal and tumor initiation capacity of ovarian CSCs and suggests DOT1L as a new cancer target.","query":"cancer"},"36318111":{"ArticleTitle":"Expansion of thermometry in magnetic hyperthermia cancer therapy: antecedence and aftermath.","AbstractText":"Magnetic hyperthermia cancer therapy (MHCT) is a promising antitumor therapy based on the generation of heat by magnetic nanoparticles under the influence of an alternating-current magnetic field. However, an often-overlooked factor hindering the translation of MHCT to clinics is the inability to accurately monitor temperature, thereby leading to erroneous thermal control. It is significant to address 'thermometry' during magnetic hyperthermia because numerous factors are affected by the magnetic fields employed, rendering traditional thermometry methods unsuitable for temperature estimation. Currently, there is a dearth of literature describing appropriate techniques for thermometry during MHCT. This review offers a general outline of the various modes of conventional thermometry as well as cutting-edge techniques operating at cellular\/nanoscale levels (nanothermometry) as prospective thermometers for MHCT in the future.","query":"cancer"},"36318106":{"ArticleTitle":"ATF3 reprograms the bone marrow niche in response to early breast cancer transformation.","AbstractText":"Cancer is a systemic disease able to reprogram the bone marrow (BM) niche towards a pro-tumorigenic state. The impact of cancer on specific BM subpopulations can qualitatively differ according the signals released by the tumor, which can vary based on the tissue of origin. Using a spontaneous model of mammary carcinoma, we identified BM mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) as the first sensors of distal cancer cells and key mediators of BM reprogramming. Through the release of IL1B, BM MSCs induced transcriptional up-regulation and nuclear translocation of the activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3) in hematopoietic stem cells. ATF3 in turn promoted the formation of myeloid progenitor clusters and sustained myeloid cell differentiation. Deletion of ATF3 specifically in the myeloid compartment reduced circulating monocytes and blocked their differentiation into tumor-associated macrophages. In the peripheral blood, the association of ATF3 expression in CD14+ mononuclear cells with the expansion CD11b+ population was able to discriminate between women with malignant or benign conditions at early diagnosis. Overall, this study identifies the IL1B\/ATF3 signaling pathway in the BM as a functional step toward the establishment of a tumor-promoting emergency myelopoiesis, suggesting that ATF3 could be tested in a clinical setting as a circulating marker of early transformation and offering the rational for testing the therapeutic benefits of IL1B inhibition in breast cancer patients.","query":"cancer"},"36318065":{"ArticleTitle":"Dendritic lipopeptide liposomes decorated with dual-targeted proteins.","AbstractText":"Due to their homing effects, cell and cell membrane-derived nanocarriers have been widely used to enhance drug target delivery.

Whereas the induction and functionality of anti-viral antibody response is largely studied, the induction of T cells upon vaccination with the different approved COVID-19 vaccines is less studied. Here, we reported on T-cell immunity four weeks and six months after different vaccination regimens and four weeks after an additional booster vaccination, in comparison to SARS-CoV-2&#160;T-cell responses in convalescents and prepandemic donors using interferon-gamma ELISpot assays and flow cytometry. Increased T-cell responses and cross-recognition of B.1.1.529 Omicron variant-specific mutations were observed ex vivo in mRNA- and heterologous-vaccinated donors compared to vector-vaccinated donors. Nevertheless, potent expandability of T cells targeting the spike protein was observed for all vaccination regimens with frequency, diversity and the ability to produce several cytokines of vaccine-induced T-cell responses comparable to those in convalescent donors. T-cell responses for all vaccinated donors significantly exceeded preexisting cross-reactive T-cell responses in prepandemic donors. Booster vaccination led to a significant increase of anti-spike IgG responses, which showed a marked decline 6 month after complete vaccination. In contrast, T-cell responses remained stable over time following complete vaccination with no significant effect of booster vaccination on T-cell responses and cross-recognition of Omicron BA.1 and BA.2 mutations.This suggested that booster vaccination is of particular relevance for the amelioration of antibody response.

Two hundred and nineteen NPC patients (175 vs. 44 for training vs. internal validation) were used to train prediction model, and thirty two NPC patients were used for external validation. We first extracted CT and dose information from intratumoral nasopharynx (GTV_nx) and lymph node (GTV_nd) regions. Then the corresponding peritumoral regions (RING_3mm and RING_5mm) were also considered. Thus, the individual and combination of intra- and peri-tumoral regions were as follows: GTV_nx, GTV_nd, RING_3mm_nx, RING_3mm_nd, RING_5mm_nx, RING_5mm_nd, GTV_nxnd, RING_3mm_nxnd, RING_5mm_nxnd, GTV+RING_3mm_nxnd and GTV+RING_5mm_nxnd. For each region, eleven models were built by combining 5 clinical parameters and 127 features from (1) dose images alone; (2-7) fused dose and CT images via wavelet-based fusion (WF) using CT weights of 0.2, 0.4, 0.6 and 0.8, gradient transfer fusion (GTF), and guided filtering-based fusion (GFF); (8) fused matrices (sumMat); (9-10) fused features derived via feature averaging (avgFea) and feature concatenation (conFea); and finally, (11) CT images alone. The C-index and Kaplan-Meier curves with log-rank test were used to assess model performance. The fusion models' performance was better than single CT\/dose model on both internal and external validation. Models combined the information from both GTV_nx and GTV_nd regions outperformed the single region model. For internal validation, GTV+RING_3mm_nxnd GFF model achieved the highest C-index both in recurrence-free survival (RFS) and metastasis-free survival (MFS) predictions (RFS: 0.822; MFS: 0.786). The highest C-index in external validation set was achieved by RING_3mm_nxnd model (RFS: 0.762; MFS: 0.719). The GTV+RING_3mm_nxnd GFF model is able to significantly separate patients into high-risk and low-risk groups compared to dose-only or CT-only models. Fusion dosiomics model combining the primary tumor, the involved lymph node, and 3mm peritumoral information outperformed single modality models for different outcome predictions, which is helpful for clinical decision-making and the development of personalized treatment.

In this report, we applied a previously described algorithm for detecting chemical complementarity between candidate cancer antigens and complementarity determining region-3 (CDR3) amino acid sequences from tumor resident T-cell receptors. Current literature indicates an association between high CDR3-cancer antigen complementarity and improved survival outcomes. For example, high CDR3-BRAF electrostatic complementarity is associated with a better melanoma outcome. However, such CDR3-cancer antigen chemical complementarity in ovarian cancer was largely associated with worse outcomes. Specifically, high CDR3-MAGEB4 and CDR3-TDRD1 electrostatic complementarity was associated with lower ovarian cancer disease free survival (DFS). Additionally, high CDR3-MAGEB4 and CDR3-TDRD1 electrostatic complementarity was associated with decreased MAGEB4\/TDRD1 gene expression and gene copy numbers, consistent with a selection against ovarian cancer cells expressing these antigens. However, when TDRD1 was split into fragments, high CDR3-TDRD1 hydrophobicity complementarity, for a specific TDRD1 fragment, was associated with increased DFS and higher immune marker expression levels.

These functions are regulated by local neuroendocrine and immune systems with a plethora of signaling molecules produced by resident and immune cells. In addition, neurotransmitters, endocrine factors, neuropeptides, and cytokines released from nerve endings play a central role in the skin responses to stress. These molecules act on the corresponding receptors in an intra-, juxta-, para- or autocrine fashion. The epidermis as the outer most component of skin forms a barrier directly protecting against environmental stressors. This protection is assured by an intrinsic keratinocyte differentiation program, pigmentary system and local nervous, immune, endocrine, and microbiome elements. These constituents communicate cross-functionally among themselves and with corresponding systems in the dermis and hypodermis to secure the basic epidermal functions to maintain local (skin) and global (systemic) homeostasis. The neurohormonal mediators and cytokines used in these communications regulate physiological skin functions separately or in concert. Disturbances in the functions in these systems lead to cutaneous pathology that includes inflammatory (psoriasis, allergic or atopic dermatitis) and keratinocytic hyperproliferative disorders (seborrheic and solar keratoses), dysfunction of adnexal structure (hair follicles, eccrine and sebaceous glands), hypersensitivity reactions, pigmentary disorders (vitiligo, melasma and hypo- or hyperpigmentary responses, premature aging, and malignancies (melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancers).

Nutritional status is closely associated with skeletal muscle mass. Here, we investigate the effect of controlling preoperative nutritional status and skeletal muscle mass on the prognosis of HCC after curative treatment. This retrospective analysis contained 181 patients who received curative treatment of HCC including liver resection or radiofrequency ablation (RFA) therapy. Nutritional status and skeletal muscle mass were evaluated prior to therapy using the controlling nutritional status (CONUT) score and psoas muscle mass index (PMI), respectively. Associations of predictor variables with overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were determined using Cox proportional hazards regression and CHAID decision tree algorithm analysis. A total of 111 patients (61.3%) were determined to be of poor nutritional status and 100 patients (55.2%) had muscle mass depletion. Patients with PS 0, Barcelona clinic liver cancer (BCLC) stage 0, low CONUT score, and high PMI showed significantly better OS than those with PS 1, BCLC stage A, high CONUT score, and low PMI. Multivariate analysis indicated that a high CONUT score [hazard ratio (HR) 4.130; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.713-9.958; P&#8201;<&#8201;0.01) and low PMI (HR 4.625; 95% CI, 1.704-12.549; P&#8201;<&#8201;0.01) found to be useful for predicting OS in patients after curative treatment of HCC.

It is associated with poor prognosis and resistance to radiation therapy and chemotherapy. In this study, we designed and synthesized borealin-derived small peptides (Bor peptides) to function as survivin-targeting agents for the diagnosis and treatment of cancers. These peptides exhibited binding affinities for recombinant human survivin (Kd = 49.6-193 nM), with Bor65-75 showing the highest affinity (Kd = 49.6 nM). Fluorescence images of fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled Bor65-75 showed its co-localization with survivin expression in the human pancreatic cancer cell line, MIA PaCa-2. In the WST-1 assay, cell penetrable nona-d-arginine-conjugated Bor65-75 (r9-Bor65-75) inhibited the growth of MIA PaCa-2 cells and MDA-MB-231 cells (89 and 88% inhibition at 10 &#956;M, respectively), whereas it had almost no effect on the human mammary epithelial cell line, MCF-10A, that inherently does not have high survivin expression. Flow cytometry with annexin V and propidium iodide staining revealed that r9-Bor65-75 induced apoptosis in MIA PaCa-2 cells in a dose-dependent manner. An increase in cleaved poly ADP-ribose polymerase protein expression was observed in MIA PaCa-2 cells exposed to r9-Bor65-75 by western blotting, suggesting that r9-Bor65-75 inhibits cell proliferation by inducing apoptosis. In vivo, r9-Bor65-75 significantly suppressed tumor growth in MIA PaCa-2 xenograft mice, without any marked weight loss. Hence, Bor peptides are promising candidates for the development of cancer imaging and anticancer agents targeting survivin.","query":"cancer"},"36317761":{"ArticleTitle":"Diagnostic value of ultrasound-guided transbronchial lung biopsy in peripheral tuberculous pulmonary lesions.","AbstractText":"To investigate the diagnostic value of bronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial lung biopsy (EBUS-TBLB) in tuberculous peripheral pulmonary lesions.

Five challenges were relevant for all diagnostic technologies: complexity of analysis; range of costs; under-developed evidence base; behavioral aspects; and choice of outcome metrics. The final five challenges were pertinent for genomic tests and only these may require methodological development: heterogeneity of tests and platforms, increasing stratification, capturing personal utility; incidental findings; and spillover effects. Current methods of economic evaluation are generally able to cope with genomic\/genetic tests, although a renewed focus on specific decision-makers' needs and a willingness to move away from cost-utility analysis may be required. Certain analysts may be constrained by reference cases developed primarily for the assessment of pharmaceuticals. The combined impact of multiple challenges may require analysts to be particularly careful in setting the scope of their analysis in order to ensure that feasibility is balanced with usefulness to the decision maker.

Different anti-PD-1 antibodies display different therapeutic properties and there is a pharmaceutical interest to generate and characterize novel anti-PD-1 antibodies. We screened multiple human antibody phage display libraries to target novel epitopes on the PD-1 surface and we discovered a unique and previously undescribed binding specificity (termed D12) from a new antibody library (termed AMG). The library featured antibody fragments in single-chain fragment variable (scFv) format, based on the IGHV3-23*03 (VH ) and IGKV1-39*01 (V&#954;) genes. The D12 antibody was characterized by surface plasmon resonance (SPR), cross-reacted with the Cynomolgus monkey antigen and bound to primary human T cells, as shown by flow cytometry. The antibody blocked the PD-1\/PD-L1 interaction in vitro with an EC50 value which was comparable to the one of nivolumab, a clinically approved antibody. The fine details of the interaction between D12 and PD-1 were elucidated by X-ray crystallography of the complex at a 3.5-&#197; resolution, revealing an unprecedented conformational change at the N-terminus of PD-1 following D12 binding, as well as partial overlap with the binding site for the cognate PD-L1 and PD-L2 ligands which prevents their binding.

Research into treatment resistance has defined a subset of patients with neuroendocrine differentiation of their prostate adenocarcinoma. Although neuroendocrine findings in conjunction with prostate adenocarcinoma can be seen in pathology samples at all stages of disease, the neuroendocrine variant of prostate cancer associated with poor outcomes occurs in approximately 20% of men with advanced disease. In this issue of JCI, Zhao, Sperger, and colleagues present data for a promising biomarker platform that can detect neuroendocrine prostate cancer after serial sampling of patients' blood with a high degree of sensitivity and specificity. This assay will be tested in several current and future trials to better define its potential clinical role and perhaps provide a greater understanding of neuroendocrine prostate cancer itself.","query":"cancer"},"36317605":{"ArticleTitle":"A Dual-Locked Tandem Fluorescent Probe for Imaging of Pyroptosis in Cancer Chemo-immunotherapy.","AbstractText":"Real-time imaging of programmed cancer cell death (PCD) is imperative to monitor cancer therapeutic efficacy and tailor therapeutic regimens; however, specific in vivo detection of intratumoral pyroptosis remains challenging. Herein, we report a dual-locked and tandem activatable probe (DTAP) for near-infrared fluorescence (NIRF) imaging of intratumoral pyroptosis during cancer chemo-immunotherapy in living mice. The probe comprises a hemicyanine dye dual-locked with an enzyme-responsive moiety that can be tandemly cleaved by pyroptosis-related biomarker (Caspase-1) and cancer biomarker (GGT) to turn on its NIRF signal. As pyroptosis plays a vital role in triggering anti-tumor immune responses, the activated signal of DTAP correlates well with the population of tumor-infiltrating cytotoxic T lymphocytes and tumor growth inhibition, consequently permitting the prediction of cancer therapeutic efficacy. This study also provides a non-invasive technique to study the regulatory mechanism of pyroptosis in cancer therapy and to optimize cancer chemo-immunotherapies for precision medicine.

However, metabolic signatures of seeds have not been studied. The seeds and bark of U. parvifolia collected at the seed ripening stage were used for metabolite profiling analysis through the untargeted metabolomics approach. A total of 2,578 and 2,207 metabolites, while 503 and 132 unique metabolites were identified in seeds and bark, respectively. Additionally, 574 differential metabolites (DEMs) were detected in the two different organs of U. parvifolia, which were grouped into 52 classes. Most kinds of metabolites classed into prenol lipids class. The relative content of flavonoids class was the highest. DEMs contained some bioactive compounds (e.g., flavonoids, terpene glycosides, triterpenoids, sesquiterpenoids) with antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-cancer activities. Most kinds of flavonoids and sesquiterpenes were up-regulated in seeds. There were more varieties of terpene glycosides and triterpenoids showing up-regulated in bark. The pathway enrichment was performed, while flavonoid biosynthesis, flavone and flavonol biosynthesis were worthy of attention. This study identified DEMs with pharmaceutical value between seeds and bark during seed maturation and offered a molecular basis for alternative or complementary use of seeds and bark of U. parvifolia as a Chinese medicinal material.","query":"cancer"},"36317596":{"ArticleTitle":"Living Leukocyte-Based Drug Delivery Systems.","AbstractText":"Leukocytes play a vital role in immune responses, including defending against invasive pathogens, reconstructing impaired tissue, and maintaining immune homeostasis.

While cancer and inflammation-related diseases like sepsis are critical medical issues that require urgent settlement plaguing humankind around the world, leukocytes have been shown to largely gather at the focal site and significantly contribute to inflammation and cancer progression. Therefore, the living leukocyte-based drug delivery systems have attracted considerable attention in recent years due to the innate and specific targeting effect, low immunogenicity, improved therapeutic efficacy, and low reverse effect. In this review, we introduce the recent advances in the development of living leukocyte-based drug delivery systems including macrophage, neutrophil, and lymphocyte as promising treatment strategies for cancer and inflammation-related diseases (e.g., immunotherapy, chemotherapy, and photodynamic therapy). We also discuss the advantages, current challenges, and limitations of the living leukocyte-based drug delivery systems, as well as provide our perspectives on the future development of precision and targeted therapy in the clinic.

A retrospective cohort study, including those exposed (n&#8201;=&#8201;7,681) and unexposed (n&#8201;=&#8201;38,405; control participants) to general anaesthesia (1:5 ratio), was conducted using national sample cohort data from 2002 to 2015. All participants were followed up for 2 years after cohort entry. The 2-year cumulative incidences of atopic dermatitis in the exposed and unexposed groups were 2.3% and 2.2%, respectively. In the subgroup analysis by age, the cumulative incidence was not significantly different between these cohorts. The risks of atopic dermatitis were not significant in the exposed group in the univariate model (hazard ratio 1.05; confidence interval 0.88-1.24) and in the multivariate model, wherein all covariates were adjusted (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.03;&#160;confidence interval 0.87-1.23).

However, the effect of LLNs without malignant characteristics on the prognosis of rectal cancer patients has been uncertain. Methods: Consecutive patients who underwent laparoscopic-assisted low anterior resection were included. Patients with MRI-detected LLNs, but without malignant characteristics, were compared with patients with no MRI-detected LLNs. Results: The local recurrence rate was higher in the LLN-present group than in the LLN-absent group (9.8% vs 2.5%; p&#160;=&#160;0.056). The overall survival of patients with no MRI-detected LLNs was significantly better than that of patients with MRI-detected LLNs (p&#160;=&#160;0.021). Conclusion: The presence of LLNs, even without malignant features, may lead to worse local control and overall survival. Lymph node metastasis in the pelvic sidewall of patients with rectal cancer is a serious disease that affects the patient's life expectancy. At present, the assessment of lateral lymph node (LLN) metastasis relies mainly on MRI. Currently, there is no consensus on whether small lymph nodes without malignant features detected by MRI affect patient prognosis. Therefore, the authors designed this study to compare the survival of patients with small LLNs detected by MRI with that of patients without LLNs. The authors found that the presence of LLNs, even without malignant features, may lead to worse local control and overall survival. Therefore, for patients with MRI-detected LLNs, LLN dissection should be conducted by experienced surgeons to improve patient prognosis.","query":"cancer"},"36317553":{"ArticleTitle":"FDG PET-CT as an important diagnostic tool and prognostic marker in suspected recurrent cervical carcinoma after radiotherapy: comparison with MRI.","AbstractText":"Recurrent disease in post-irradiation patients with cervical cancer is often difficult to delineate on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), because posttreatment changes can have a similar appearance, and further evaluation is often required.

This cohort retrospective study included patients previously treated with radiotherapy for carcinoma of uterine cervix with suspected recurrence, who had undergone MRI of abdomen and pelvis, and were subsequently evaluated on FDG PET-CT, with minimum follow-up period of 12 months. In the total of 84 patients included in analysis, MRI vs. FDG PET-CT showed sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of 80.1%, 52.4% and 66.7%, vs. 97.6%, 61.9% and 79.8%, respectively. Patients with positive findings on MRI (Log Rank, p = 0.003) and PET-CT (Log Rank, p < 0.001) had shorter progression-free survival (PFS) than those with negative results. In univariate Cox regression models, MRI and FDG PET-CT results were found to be related to PFS (p = 0.005 and p < 0.001, respectively). However, multivariate analysis proved only FDG PET-CT to be independent prognostic factor, where patients with positive FDG PET-CT results had almost nine times higher risk of progression (p < 0.001).

Persistent use of opioids for more than 90&#8201;days after surgery is problematic, and the incidence of this adverse outcome has been reported in the civilian population ranging from 0.4% to 7%. Veterans compose a special population exposed to trauma and stressful situations and consequently face increased risk for habit-forming behavior and drug overdose. This evaluation determined the prevalence of opioid persistence after surgery and its relationship to patient characteristics in a military veteran population. A retrospective chart review was completed on 1,257 veterans who were opioid naive and had undergone a surgical procedure between January 2017 and May 2018. Patient characteristics, health conditions, and discharge opioid medications were recorded, and the incidence of persistent opioid use beyond 90&#8201;days was determined. The incidence of opioid persistence following major (3.3%) and minor (3.4%) procedures was similar. The incidence in patients younger than 45&#8201;years (3.3%), between 45 and 64&#8201;years (4.3%), and 65&#8201;years and older (2.2%) was also determined to be similar. Univariate patient factors associated with an increased risk for persistent opioid use include cancer (odds ratio [OR], 2.13; 95% CI, 1.11-4.09), mental health disorders (OR, 2.32; 95% CI, 1.17-4.60), and substance use disorders (OR, 2.09; 95% CI, 1.09-4.00).

To improve unfavorable signal-to-noise ratios, an effective way is to shield the noise signal of these nanoprobes in non-targeted areas. Fortunately, there is a natural mutual shielding effect between some imaging nanomaterials, which provides the possibility of designing engineered nanomaterials with imaging quenching between two different components at the beginning. Once in the tumor microenvironment, the two components will present activated dual-mode imaging ability because of their separation, designated as two-way imaging tuning.

Despite its importance, the SAN is one of the most poorly understood cardiac entities because of its small size and complex composition and function. The Hippo signaling pathway is a molecular signaling pathway fundamental to heart development and regeneration. Although abnormalities of the Hippo pathway are associated with cardiac arrhythmias in human patients, the role of this pathway in the SAN is unknown. We investigated key regulators of the Hippo pathway in SAN pacemaker cells by conditionally inactivating the Hippo signaling kinases Lats1 and Lats2 using the tamoxifen-inducible, cardiac conduction system-specific Cre driver Hcn4CreERT2 with Lats1 and Lats2 conditional knockout alleles. In addition, the Hippo-signaling effectors Yap and Taz were conditionally inactivated in the SAN. To determine the function of Hippo signaling in the SAN and other cardiac conduction system components, we conducted a series of physiological and molecular experiments, including telemetry ECG recording, echocardiography, Masson Trichrome staining, calcium imaging, immunostaining, RNAscope, cleavage under targets and tagmentation sequencing using antibodies against Yap1 or H3K4me3, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, and Western blotting. We also performed comprehensive bioinformatics analyses of various datasets. We found that Lats1\/2 inactivation caused severe sinus node dysfunction. Compared with the controls, Lats1\/2 conditional knockout mutants exhibited dysregulated calcium handling and increased fibrosis in the SAN, indicating that Lats1\/2 function through both cell-autonomous and non-cell-autonomous mechanisms. It is notable that the Lats1\/2 conditional knockout phenotype was rescued by genetic deletion of Yap and Taz in the cardiac conduction system, and these rescued mice had normal sinus rhythm and reduced fibrosis of the SAN, indicating that Lats1\/2 function through Yap and Taz cleavage under targets and tagmentation sequencing data showed that Yap potentially regulates genes critical for calcium homeostasis such as Ryr2 and genes encoding paracrine factors important in intercellular communication and fibrosis induction such as Tgfb1 and Tgfb3. Consistent with this, Lats1\/2 conditional knockout mutants had decreased Ryr2 expression and increased Tgfb1 and Tgfb3 expression compared with control mice. We reveal, for the first time to our knowledge, that the canonical Hippo-Yap pathway plays a pivotal role in maintaining SAN homeostasis.","query":"cancer"},"36317527":{"ArticleTitle":"All-cause and liver-related mortality risk factors in excessive drinkers: Analysis of data from the UK biobank.","AbstractText":"High alcohol intake is associated with increased mortality.

Mortality Hazard Ratios for these excessive drinkers, compared to all other participants, were 2.02 (95% CI 1.89-2.17) for all causes, 1.89 (1.69-2.12) for any cancer, 1.87 (1.61-2.17) for any circulatory disease and 9.40 (7.00-12.64) for any liver disease. Liver disease diagnosis or abnormal liver function tests predicted not only deaths attributed to liver disease but also those from cancers or circulatory diseases. Mortality among excessive drinkers was also associated with quantitative alcohol intake; diagnosed alcohol dependence, harmful use or withdrawal syndrome; and current smoking at assessment. People with chronic excessive alcohol intake experience decreased average survival but there is substantial variation in their mortality, with liver abnormality and alcohol dependence or other alcohol use disorders associated with worse prognosis.

In this retrospective cohort study using nation-wide registers, we followed all Danes born in 1971-2018 (n&#8201;=&#8201;2,576,011) from 1977 through 2018 for hospital contacts with an infectious mononucleosis diagnosis (n&#8201;=&#8201;23,905) or a multiple sclerosis diagnosis (n&#8201;=&#8201;4,442), defining two different end points. Relative risks (hazard ratios) of each end point as a function of sibship constellation were obtained from stratified Cox regression analyses. The hazard ratios of interest for infectious mononucleosis and multiple sclerosis could be assumed identical (test for homogeneity P&#8201;=&#8201;0.19), implying that having siblings especially of younger age may protect a person against multiple sclerosis through early exposure to Epstein-Barr virus. The maximum protection per sibling was obtained by having a 0-2 years younger sibling, corresponding to a hazard ratio of 0.80 with 95% confidence interval (0.76-0.85). The corresponding hazard ratio from having an (0 to 2 years) older sibling was 0.91 (0.86-0.96). Our results suggest that it may be possible to essentially eradicate multiple sclerosis by an Epstein-Barr virus vaccine administered before teenage years. Getting there would require both successful replication of our study findings and if so elucidation of why early Epstein-Barr virus infection usually will not trigger the immune mechanisms responsible for the association between delayed Epstein-Barr virus infection and multiple sclerosis risk.","query":"cancer"},"36317454":{"ArticleTitle":"miR-138-5p inhibits the progression of colorectal cancer via regulating SP1\/LGR5 axis.","AbstractText":"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the main malignancies that seriously threaten human health. Considering the high mortality and morbidity associated with this disease, even surgical resection and chemotherapy may not be sufficient in certain cases. This study aimed to explore the molecular mechanisms of miR-138-5p in regulating CRC progression. Quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and western blot were performed to assess the levels of mRNA and proteins, including miR-138-5p, leucine-rich repeat-containing G protein-coupled receptor 5 (LGR5), SP1, &#946;-catenin, cyclin D1, and c-myc. The bioactivities of LoVo and HCT116 cells were assessed via MTT assay, flow cytometry, and transwell assay. StarBase was used to identify the downstream targets of genes. Double luciferase reporter and RIP assays revealed the direct binding of miR-138-5p to SP1 and of SP1 to LGR5. Our results illustrated that miR-138-5p was downregulated in CRC and its knockdown accelerated CRC progression. Conversely, SP1 was upregulated in CRC and its knockdown inhibited CRC progression. SP1 is also targeted by miR-138-5p and binds to LGR5. This study showed that miR-138-5p inhibits LoVo and HCT116 cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Overall, miR-138-5p regulates CRC progression and promotes apoptosis via the SP1\/LGR5 axis. This study indicates that miR-138-5p is involved in regulating CRC progression.","query":"cancer"},"36317450":{"ArticleTitle":"Celastrol acts as a new histone deacetylase inhibitor to inhibit colorectal cancer cell growth via regulating macrophage polarity.","AbstractText":"The tumorigenesis and progression of colorectal cancer are closely related to the tumor microenvironment, especially inflammatory response. Inhibitors of histone deacetylase (HDAC) have been reported as epigenetic regulators of the immune system to treat cancer and inflammatory diseases and our results demonstrated that Celastrol could act as a new HDAC inhibitor. Considering macrophages as important members of the tumor microenvironment, we further found that Celastrol could influence the polarization of macrophages to inhibit colorectal cancer cell growth. Specially, we used the supernatant of HCT116 and SW480 cells to induce Ana-1 cells in vitro and chose the spontaneous colorectal cancer model APCmin\/+ mice as an animal model to validate in vivo. The results indicated that Celastrol could reverse the polarization of macrophages from M2 to M1 through impacting the colorectal tumor microenvironment both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, using bioinformatics analysis, we found that Celastrol might mechanistically polarize the macrophages through MAPK signaling pathway. In conclusion, our findings identified that Celastrol as a new HDAC inhibitor and suggested that Celastrol could modulate macrophage polarization, thus inhibiting colorectal cancer growth, which may provide some novel therapeutic strategies for colorectal cancer.","query":"cancer"},"36317444":{"ArticleTitle":"Editorial Comment.","AbstractText":"","query":"cancer"},"36317440":{"ArticleTitle":"Serial enrichment of heteroduplex DNA using a MutS-magnetic bead system.","AbstractText":"Numerous applications in molecular biology and genomics require characterization of mutant DNA molecules present at low levels within a larger sample of non-mutant DNA. This is often achieved either by selectively amplifying mutant DNA, or by sequencing all the DNA followed by computational identification of the mutant DNA. However, selective amplification is challenging for insertions and deletions (indels). Additionally, sequencing all the DNA in a sample may not be cost effective when only the presence of a mutation needs to be ascertained rather than its allelic fraction. The MutS protein evolved to detect DNA heteroduplexes in which the two DNA strands are mismatched. Prior methods have utilized MutS to enrich mutant DNA by hybridizing mutant to non-mutant DNA to create heteroduplexes. However, the purity of heteroduplex DNA these methods achieve is limited because they can only feasibly perform one or two enrichment cycles. We developed a MutS-magnetic bead system that enables rapid serial enrichment cycles. With six cycles, we achieve complete purification of heteroduplex indel DNA originally present at a 5% fraction and over 40-fold enrichment of heteroduplex DNA originally present at a 1% fraction. This system may enable novel approaches for enriching mutant DNA for targeted sequencing. This article is protected by copyright.

Conventional chemotherapeutic agents that are otherwise the standard-of-care in LCH may be counterproductive in patients with hepatic decompensation. Furthermore, the precise role of liver transplantation (LT) in the management of LCH remains unclear. Review of a prospectively collected database (January 2014 to December 2020) of children with liver disease was performed. All clinical details of patients with LCH managed at our center were collected and data analyzed. Based on the outcomes, a management algorithm was proposed. Of the eight (five male) patients referred to our unit, six (75%) underwent LT (four and two for compensated and decompensated cirrhosis, respectively). Median age at diagnosis of LCH was 25 (range: 9-48) months. Two patients, who had previously completed LCH-specific chemotherapy, underwent upfront LT for compensated cirrhosis. Other two patients with compensated cirrhosis showed evidence of active disease. They underwent LT following completion of chemotherapy. Two children with decompensated cirrhosis also had evidence of active disease and were started on modified chemotherapy Both of them had progression of liver disease while on chemotherapy. Hence, an urgent LT was performed which was followed by completion of chemotherapy in these patients. On a median follow-up of 30.5 (10.5-50) months, all post-LT patients were alive with stable graft function and showed no disease recurrence. We demonstrate that an algorithmic approach, along with newer chemotherapeutic agents, results in excellent outcomes in LCH patients with liver involvement.

Cuproptosis is a recently discovered cell death attracting significant attention in the tumour field. Whether cuproptosis-related genes have prognostic predictive value has not been clarified. In this study, uni-\/multi-variate Cox and Lasso regression analyses were applied to construct a risk model based on cuproptosis-related lncRNAs using TCGA and CGGA cohorts. A nomogram was constructed to quantify individual risk, including clinical and genic characteristics and risk. GO and KEGG analyses were used to define functional enrichment of DEGs. Tumour mutation burden (TMB) and immune checkpoint analyses were performed to evaluate potential responses to ICI therapy. Ten prognostic lncRNAs were obtained from Cox regression. Based on the median risk score, patients were divided into high- and low-risk groups. Either for grade 2-3 or for grade 4, glioma patients with high-risk exhibited significant poorer prognoses. The risk was an independent risk factor associated with overall survival. The high-risk group was functionally associated with immune responses and cancer-related pathways. The high-risk group was associated with higher TMB scores. The expression levels of many immune checkpoints in the high-risk group were significantly higher than those in the low-risk group. Differentiated immune pathways were primarily enriched in the IFN response, immune checkpoint and T-cell co-stimulation pathways.

Our objective is to design a segmentation framework named Multi-scale Contextual Semantic Enhancement Network (3D MCSE-Net) to address the above problems. The 3D MCSE-Net mainly consists of a Multi-scale Context Pyramid Fusion Module (MCPFM), a Triple Feature Adaptive Enhancement Module (TFAEM), and an Asymmetric Class Correction Loss (ACCL) function. Specifically, the MCPFM resolves the problem of unreliable predictions due to variable morphology and drastic scale variations of lesions by capturing the multi-scale global context of feature maps. Subsequently, the TFAEM overcomes the problem of blurred boundaries of lesions caused by the infiltrating growth and complex context of lesions by adaptively recalibrating and enhancing the multi-dimensional feature representation of suspicious regions. Moreover, the ACCL alleviates class imbalances by adjusting asymmetric correction coefficient and weighting factor.

Cancer pain due to bone metastases is the most common form of pain in patients with advanced disease and has been shown to significantly reduce patients' quality of life. Treatment options for cancer pain due to bone metastases include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, palliative radiation, bisphosphonates, denosumab, and opioids. Therapies including palliative radiation and opioids have strong evidence supporting their efficacy treating cancer pain due to bone metastases; other therapies, like bisphosphonates and denosumab, do not. There is sufficient evidence that patients who experience pain relief after radiation therapy have improved quality of life; however, a substantial proportion are nonresponders. For those still requiring pain management, even with available analgesics, many patients are undertreated for cancer pain due to bone metastases, indicating an unmet need. The studies in this review were not designed to determine why cancer pain due to bone metastases was undertreated.

Herein, we aimed to investigate the effect of PPI on the stem cell-like features of LCSCs and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). LCSCs were enriched in a serum-free medium and treated with PPI, sorafenib (Sora), or PPI and Sora. Several endpoints, including spheroid formation and differentiation, cell proliferation, surface markers of LCSCs, PPI binding targets, and stemness-associated protein expression, were evaluated. Immunofluorescence staining, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, siRNA transfection, and coimmunoprecipitation ubiquitination assays were conducted for in-depth mechanistic studies. Evaluation of in vivo antitumor efficacy demonstrated that PPI effectively inhibited the proliferation of liver cancer cells and the self-renewal and differentiation of LCSCs. Flow cytometry indicated that PPI suppressed the expression of the stem cell surface markers EpCAM and CD13. Molecular docking showed a high affinity between PPI and proteins of the Wnt\/&#946;-catenin signaling pathway, including AKT, GSK-3&#946;, and &#946;-catenin, with the binding energies of -5.51, -5.32, and -5.40&#8201;kcal\/mol, respectively, which suggested that PPI might regulate the Wnt\/&#946;-catenin signaling pathway to affect the stem cell-like properties of HCC.

However, it is still unclear whether stand-alone HR-HPV mRNA testing is sufficient for primary screening. The purpose of this study was to investigate the feasibility of a stand-alone HR-HPV mRNA assay for primary screening of cervical cancer. Women aged 21 and older were recruited in Fujian Province, China, from January 2020 to January 2022. Cervical exfoliated cells were collected for cervical cytology and HR-HPV mRNA assays, and women with positive results on either assay were referred for colposcopy. The screening effectiveness of the assay was calculated based on the cervical histology. When comparing the efficacy of the different screening strategies, only women aged 25 and older were included. A total of 9927 women were recruited. This study identified 217 cases of high-grade squamous intraepithelial disease or worse (HSIL+). The overall age-specific HR-HPV infection rate showed a U-shaped distribution. The sensitivity of the HR-HPV mRNA assay to identify CIN2+ and CIN3+ was 97.2% and 97.9%, respectively, which was significantly higher than that of cytology (82.9% and 88.6%, P<0.001 and 0.002). The sensitivity of the HR-HPV mRNA primary screening strategy to identify CIN2+ and CIN3+ was 92.2% and 94.3%, respectively, which was similar to the co-testing strategy (P=0.336 and 0.394) and higher than the cytology primary screening (P=0.002 and 0.048). In addition, the HR-HPV primary screening strategy had a lower referral rate for colposcopy than cytology primary screening (5.4% vs 6.6%, P<0.001), and the screening cost was lower than co-testing ($29,594.3 per 1000 screened women vs $55,140 per 1000 screened women, P<0.001). In conclusion, the detection of CIN2+\/CIN3+ by HR-HPV mRNA is both specific and sensitive. It may be suitable for primary screening of cervical cancer in China.","query":"cancer"},"36316987":{"ArticleTitle":"Increased risk of cancer and mortality in a large French population-based paediatric-onset inflammatory bowel disease retrospective cohort.","AbstractText":"Paediatric-onset IBD (pIBD) is associated with an increased risk of cancer and mortality in adulthood. The aims of this study were to measure the incidence of cancer and mortality in patients with pIBD and identify factors associated with mortality and cancer.

Here, we detected the presence of arboviruses ZIKV, DENV and CHIKV and their coinfections in women in endemic regions of the city of Fortaleza, Cear&#225; in a post-Zika epidemic year. Sociodemographic and environmental characteristics associated with arbovirus positivity were also analyzed. Women (n&#8201;=&#8201;1289) between 15 and 39&#8201;years old were included. RT-qPCR was performed for virus detection and IgM antibody positivity was also analyzed. One hundred and six (8.3%) participants were positive for one or more arboviruses. Monoinfections (76; 5.9%) were distributed between 22 (1.7%) for ZIKV, 39 (3.1%) for DENV and 15 (1.2%) for CHIKV. Co-infections were detected in 30 (2.3%) of the positive participants and one case with triple infection was found. IgM positivity was found in 2.4% of ZIKV RT-qPCR, 9.6% of DENV and 16.3% of CHIKV. RT-qPCR positivity for arboviruses was associated with low socioeconomic class and presence of a water box sealing in the household. A higher positivity to the three viruses occurred in the month with the lowest wind velocity, which was also preceded by the highest peak of rain and humidity.

It is a rare condition and the pathogenesis is not fully understood. In addition, the indistinguishable radiological appearance of immature and mature teratomas, and limited pathology samples make an accurate diagnosis difficult in most cases. More importantly, patients are also at risk of recurrence after surgery. This report aims to describe the process of diagnosis and treatment of GP with immature teratoma. The patient, a 38-year-old woman presented with GP complicated with immature teratoma after laparoscopic ovarian cyst excision. On physical examination, a 15 cm-pelvic mass, with poor mobility, was palpated. And tumor marker demonstrated a moderate increase in &#945;-fetoprotein and carbohydrate antigen 125. We suspected malignancy according to the comprehensive preoperative evaluation, the postoperative pathology revealed an immature teratoma of the left ovary and complicated with gliomatosis peritonei. Three months after the second surgery, possible recurrence of immature teratoma was considered and the patient underwent the third laparotomy. But the postoperative pathology indicated mature teratoma and mature glial components in the pelvic lesions. The patient underwent 2 more surgical resections after the initial resection and 3 cycles of bleomycin, etoposide, and cisplatin regimen chemotherapy. She was regularly followed up in the outpatient after surgery, and no recurrence has been reported in the pelvic cavity till date. The case illuminated that the primary diagnosis of GP complicated with immature teratoma is critical but highly challenging for both gynecologists and pathologists and more attention should be paid to \"GP complicated with immature cystic teratoma\" patients to avoid inappropriate treatment.","query":"cancer"},"36316905":{"ArticleTitle":"Thoracolaparoscopic esophagectomy for esophageal cancer with a cervical or abdominal incision to extract specimen.","AbstractText":"Surgery is the only curative approach for resectable esophageal cancer.

Therefore, We hypothesize that PCa can be stratified into metabolic subgroups based on glycolytic and cholesterogenic related genes, and the different subgroups are closely related to the immune microenvironment. Bioinformatics analysis of genomic, transcriptomic, and clinical data from a comprehensive cohort of PCa patients was performed. Datasets included the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) dataset, GSE70768, our previously published PCa cohort. The unsupervised cluster analysis was employed to stratify PCa samples based on the expression of metabolic-related genes. Four molecular subtypes were identified, named Glycolytic, Cholesterogenic, Mixed, and Quiescent. Each metabolic subtype has specific features. Among the 4 subtypes, the cholesterogenic subtype exhibited better median survival, whereas patients with high expression of glycolytic genes showed the shortest survival. The mitochondrial pyruvate carriers (MPC) 1 exhibited expression difference between PCa metabolic subgroups, but not for MPCs 2. Glycolytic subtypes had lower immune cell scores, while Cholesterogenic subgroups had higher immune cell scores.

In GSE60502, GSE76427, and GSE84402, we performed differential expression analysis to obtain differentially expressed genes (DEGs). In the The Cancer Genome Atlas database, the FPKM expression profile was subjected to weighted gene co-expression analysis to obtain modules closely related to HCC. We received common genes by intersecting the genes in the module with the differential genes. Then, we fused the common genes' expression profiles, survival time, and survival status for univariate, Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator, and multivariate COX regression analysis to obtain prognostic genes. Predictive genes were performed in K-M survival analysis and combined with clinical data for independent predictive analysis. After differential expression analysis, GSE60502 obtained 1107 DEGs, GSE76427 obtained 424 DEGs, and GSE84402 obtained 1668 DEGs. Through weighted gene co-expression analysis analysis, we can see that the blue and brown modules were closely associated with HCC. After single and multivariate COX regression analysis, we found that suppressor of cytokine signaling 2 (SOCS2) and SERPINF2 were independent prognostic genes for HCC. After survival analysis, HCC patients with high expression of SOCS2 and SERPINF2 had a longer survival time. These 2 genes in normal liver tissues were higher than in HCC at the transcriptional level. SOCS2 and SERPINF2 were new independent prognostic genes of HCC. So, they may provide new treatment methods and measures for diagnosing HCC.","query":"cancer"},"36316887":{"ArticleTitle":"Hemodynamic derangement associated with tension pneumomediastinum during minimally invasive esophagectomy: A case report.","AbstractText":"Surgery is the treatment of choice for esophageal cancer.

The expression of LIMK1, LIMK2, Cofilin-1 and p-Cofilin-1 in the GC tissues and adjacent normal stomach tissues from 141 patients were detected using immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining. Wilcoxon rank-sum test and Spearman rank correlation coefficients were used to measure the relationship between different TNM stages, pathological types, and selected parameters. OS was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and survival curves were compared using the log-rank test. Our results showed that, compared to those in the adjacent normal stomach tissues, LIMK1, LIMK2 and Cofilin-1 were up-regulated while p-Cofilin-1 was down-regulated in the GC tissues. LIMK1 level was positively correlated to the TNM stages of GC. According to the published dataset, the expression levels of both LIMK1 and LIMK2 were correlated to the overall survival time of GC patients. The level of Cofilin-1 was significantly different between GCs of different TNM stages. Moreover, most importantly, this is the first study to reveal that the level of Cofilin-1 is higher, and the level of p-Cofilin-1 is lower in the diffuse type of GC compared to that in intestinal type. Taken together, our study demonstrated that multiple factors in LIMK\/Cofilin pathway including LIMK1, LIMK2, Cofilin-1, and p-Cofilin-1 were associated with the clinical and pathological features of GC, which is potentially helpful for the diagnosis and treatment of GC.","query":"cancer"},"36316864":{"ArticleTitle":"Prewarming non-inflatable cuff laryngeal mask for mechanical ventilation: A systematic review and meta-analysis with trial sequential analysis.","AbstractText":"Non-inflatable cuff laryngeal masks are generally composed of thermoplastic material.

Seroma formation, which causes pain and tension, together with the limitations of shoulder and arm movements, can cause wound healing problems that can progress to wound dehiscence and flap necrosis. The aim of our study was to investigate the effects of continuous drainage and negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) in breast cancer patients with refractory postmastectomy seroma. This retrospectively designed study was conducted with 27 patients who were referred to our center between 2018 and 2021 due to refractory seroma after mastectomy. The inclusion criteria of the study were the cases who were planned minimally invasive debridement and NPWT due to having refractory seroma formation with at least 200 cc and having interventions more than 1 month after modified radical mastectomy (MRM), despite conventional treatment methods. All patients' demographics, disease stage, history of possible neoadjuvant therapy, comorbidities, body mass index (BMI), number of wound dressings with NPWT, and total amount of NPWT accumulation were enrolled and compared statistically. Twenty-seven patients included in the study underwent continuous drainage after debridement, and 5 (3-9) dressings were treated with NPWT. None of the patients experienced complications after debridement and NPWT administration. In refractory seroma cases seen after postmastectomy, NPWT especially for the management of debridement and dead space can be evaluated as an appropriate treatment method in patients with high flow rate seroma.","query":"cancer"},"36316846":{"ArticleTitle":"Serum amyloid A (SAA) and Interleukin-6 (IL-6) as the potential biomarkers for gastric cancer.","AbstractText":"To explore serum amyloid A (SAA) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) as potential diagnostic biomarkers for gastric cancer (GCa) and the application value of the combined diagnosis of SAA, IL6, and Cancer embryonic antigen.

Despite the close KS-HIV relationship, no study has reported the existence of HIV in KS tissue. We used ddPCR to detect HIV and KSHV in HIV+ KS samples and classic KS control. We verified KS cell types through immunohistochemistry and applied hypersensitive in situ hybridization (ISH) to detect HIV and KSHV in tumor cells. Furthermore, we co-stained samples with ISH and immunohistochemistry to identify HIV and KSHV in specific cell types. Regarding pathological stages, the KS were nodular (58.3%), plaque (33.3%), and patch (8.3%) tumors. Moreover, ddPCR revealed HIV in 58.3% of the KS samples. ISH revealed positive Pol\/Gag mRNA signals in CD34 + tumor cells from HIV + patients (95.8%). HIV signals were absent in macrophages and other inflammatory cells. Most HIV + KS cells showed scattered reactive particles of HIV and KSHV. We demonstrated that HIV could infect CD34 + tumor cells and coexist with KSHV in KS, constituting a novel finding.

They commonly occur in the neck and axilla, while involvement of the pericardium is rare. We report herein the case of a 16-month-old Sri Lankan child with a large pericardial cystic lymphangioma presenting with sudden-onset shortness of breath. A 16-month-old Sri Lankan boy presented with sudden-onset dyspnea for 1-day duration following a febrile illness that lasted 2 days. On examination, he was afebrile and had subcostal, intercostal, and suprasternal recessions, with a respiratory rate of 50 breaths per minute. He had a loud expiratory grunt. The chest expansion was reduced on the right side, which was dull to percussion. Auscultation revealed a marked reduction of air entry over the right lower and mid zones. Chest X-ray showed a well-demarcated opacity involving the lower and mid zones of the right hemithorax associated with a tracheal shift to the opposite side. Ultrasound scan of the chest revealed fluid-filled right hemithorax suggesting a septate pleural effusion. A contrast-enhanced computed tomography scan of the thorax showed a large multiloculated extrapulmonary cystic lesion involving the right hemithorax with a mediastinal shift towards the left side associated with displacement of the right-side mediastinal structures. He underwent mini-thoracotomy and surgical excision of the cyst. A large cyst originating from the pericardium was observed and excised during surgery. Histological examination revealed a lesion composed of cysts devoid of a lining epithelium but separated by connective tissue, mature adipose tissue, and lymphoid aggregates. The child showed complete recovery postoperatively with full expansion of the ipsilateral lung. We report the case of a patient with cystic lymphangioma who was perfectly well and asymptomatic until 16 months of age. This case report presents the very rare occurrence of a large cystic lymphangioma originating from the pericardium. It highlights the importance of considering rare possibilities and performing prompt imaging in situations of diagnostic uncertainty to arrive at an accurate diagnosis that can be lifesaving.","query":"cancer"},"36316782":{"ArticleTitle":"Whole-cell tumor vaccines desialylated to uncover tumor antigenic Gal\/GalNAc epitopes elicit anti-tumor immunity.","AbstractText":"Aberrant sialoglycans on the surface of tumor cells shield potential tumor antigen epitopes, escape recognition, and suppress activation of immunocytes. &#945;2,3\/&#945;2,6Gal- and &#945;2,6GalNAc (Gal\/GalNAc)-linked sialic acid residues of sialoglycans could affect macrophage galactose-type lectins (MGL) mediated-antigen uptake and presentation and promote sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectins (Siglecs) mediated-immunosuppression. Desialylating sialoglycans on tumor cells could present tumor antigens with Gal\/GalNAc residues and overcome glyco-immune checkpoints. Thus, we explored whether vaccination with desialylated whole-cell tumor vaccines (DWCTVs) triggers anti-tumor immunity in ovarian cancer (OC). Sialic acid (Sia) and Gal\/GalNAc residues on OC A2780, OVCAR3, and ID8 cells treated with &#945;2-3 neuraminidase (&#945;2-3NA) and &#945;2-6NA, and Sigec-9 or Siglec-E and MGL on DCs pulsed with desialylated OC cells were identified using flow cytometry (FCM); RT-qPCR determined IFNG expression of T cells, TRBV was sequenced using Sanger sequencing and cytotoxicity of &#945;&#946; T cells was measured with LDH assay; Anti-tumor immunity in vivo was validated via vaccination with desialylated whole-cell ID8 vaccine (ID8 DWCTVs).

We present the case of a patient with advanced basal cell carcinoma and metastatic muscle-invasive urothelial cancer, who was treated with the programmed death-ligand 1 inhibitor, atezolizumab for both cancers. A 72-year-old Caucasian female patient, with a history of smoking without any comorbidities developed periocular basal cell carcinoma, which was surgically removed but relapsed 4&#160;years later. Surgical excision was carried out twice, but with positive margins, therefore definitive radiotherapy was given. Subsequently, the patient developed non-muscle-invasive papillary urothelial carcinoma, which was removed by transurethral resection. Follow-up was irregular owing to the patient's inadequate compliance, and within 2&#160;years, the patient's cancer relapsed and histology confirmed muscle-invasive urothelial carcinoma. Definitive radiochemotherapy was not accepted by the patient. Meanwhile, the patient's basal cell carcinoma had also progressed, despite receiving vismodegib therapy. Therefore, the patient was administered epirubicin-cisplatin. Having reached the maximum cumulative dose of epirubicin, treatment with this chemotherapeutic agent could not be continued. The patient developed bladder cancer metastasis in her left suprainguinal lymph nodes. Owing to the presence of both types of tumors, programmed death-ligand 1 inhibitor atezolizumab treatment was chosen. In just over 1&#160;year, the patient received 17 cycles of atezolizumab altogether, which was tolerated well without any adverse or side effects. Follow-up imaging scans indicated complete remission of the metastatic bladder cancer and stable disease of the basal cell carcinoma. The patient subsequently passed away in hospital due to a complication of COVID-19 infection. Our patient attained stable disease in advanced basal cell carcinoma and complete remission in metastatic muscle-invasive urothelial cancer after receiving programmed death-ligand 1 inhibitor, atezolizumab, therapy. To our knowledge, this is the first paper to report the use of programmed death-ligand 1 inhibitor, atezolizumab, as treatment for advanced basal cell carcinoma. This case may also be of interest for clinicians when treating patients with two synchronous cancers.","query":"cancer"},"36316776":{"ArticleTitle":"Potential role of autophagy induced by FLT3-ITD and acid ceramidase in acute myeloid leukemia chemo-resistance: new insights.","AbstractText":"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a type of leukemia with a poor prognosis and survival characterized by abnormal cell proliferation and differentiation. Despite advances in treatment, AML still has a low complete remission rate, particularly in elderly patients, and recurrences are frequently seen even after complete remissions. The major challenge in treating AML is the resistance of leukemia cells to chemotherapy drugs. Thus, to overcome this issue, it can be crucial to conduct new investigations to explore the mechanisms of chemo-resistance in AML and target them. In this review, the potential role of autophagy induced by FLT3-ITD and acid ceramidase in chemo-resistance in AML patients are analyzed. With regard to the high prevalence of FLT3-ITD mutation (about 25% of AML cases) and high level of acid ceramidase in these patients, we hypothesized that both of these factors could lead to chemo-resistance by inducing autophagy. Therefore, pharmacological targeting of autophagy, FLT3-ITD, and acid ceramidase production could be a promising therapeutic approach for such AML patients to overcome chemo-resistance.

However, whether the steroid receptor coactivator-3 (SRC-3) modulates TIME to progress breast cancer is unclear. Therefore, the present study evaluates whether SRC-3 generates a tumor-promoting TIME in breast tumors using a syngeneic immune-intact mouse model of breast cancer. We employed E0771 and 4T1 breast cancer in immune-intact syngeneic female C57BL\/6 and BALB\/c mice, respectively. SI-2, a specific small-molecule inhibitor of SRC-3, was administered daily (2.5&#160;mg\/kg) to E0771 and 4T1 breast tumor-bearing immune-intact mice. In addition, SRC-3 knockdown (KD)-E0771 and SRC-3 KD-4T1 cells and their parental breast cancer cells were injected into their syngeneic immune-intact female mice versus immune-deficiency mice to validate that the host immune system is required for breast tumor suppression by SRC-3 KD in immune-intact mice. Furthermore, tumor-infiltrating immune cells (such as CD4+, CD8+, CD56+, and Foxp3+ cells) in E0771 and 4T1 breast cancers treated with SI-2 and in SRC-3 KD E0771 and 4T1 breast cancers were determined by immunohistochemistry. Additionally, cytokine levels in SI-2-treated and SRC-3 KD E0771 breast tumors and their control cancers were defined with a Mouse Cytokine Array. SRC-3 inhibition by SI-2 significantly suppressed the progression of breast cancer cells (E0771 and 4T1) into breast cancers in immune-intact syngeneic female mice. SRC-3 KD-E0771 and -4T1 breast cancer cells did not produce well-developed tumors in immune-intact syngeneic female mice compared to their parental cells, but SRC-3 KD breast cancers were well developed in immune-defective host mice. SRC-3 inhibition by SI-2 and SRC-3 KD effectively increased the numbers of cytotoxic immune cells, such as CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and CD56+ NK cells, and Interferon &#947; (Ifng) in breast cancers compared to vehicle. However, SI-2 treatment reduced the number of tumor-infiltrating CD4+\/Foxp3+ regulatory T (Treg) cells compared to vehicle treatment. In addition, SRC-3 inhibition by SI-2 and SRC-3 KD increased C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 9 (Cxcl9) expression in breast cancer to recruit C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 3 (Cxcr3)-expressing cytotoxic immune cells into breast tumors. SRC-3 is a critical immunomodulator in breast cancer, generating a protumor immune microenvironment. SRC-3 inhibition by SI-2 or SRC-3 KD activates the Cxcl9\/Cxcr3 axis in breast tumors and enhances the antitumor immune microenvironment to suppress breast cancer progression.","query":"cancer"},"36316774":{"ArticleTitle":"The association between parenteral nutrition and pancreatic injury in adult patients: a retrospective observational study.","AbstractText":"Patients on parenteral nutrition (PN) are at high risk of both liver and pancreatic injury.

Although ALL complete remission (CR) rate has increased to 85-90% after induction chemotherapy, 40-50% of patients eventually relapsed. Therefore, it is necessary to improve the outcomes of ALL via accurate diagnosis and individualized treatments, which benefits in part from molecular biomarkers. Here, we identified a new fusion gene, Acyl-CoA Thioesterase 7-Nephrocystin 4 (ACOT7-NPHP4), in a 34-year-old patient with ALL. The fusion gene contributed to chemoresistance to doxorubicin and acted as a new molecular marker. A 34-year-old male patient was diagnosed with ALL (common B cell) based on clinical manifestations and laboratory results. Although the patient received two cycles of the hyper-CVAD-L regimen as chemotherapy, the induction treatment failed. Because of the refusal of further treatments, the patient died of rapid progression of ALL one month later. Finally, a new fusion transcript, ACOT7-NPHP4, was detected in the patient's lymphoblastic leukemia cells via RNA sequencing. This is the first report of a patient with ALL carrying an ACOT7-NPHP4 fusion gene. These findings may help understand the impact of ACOT7-NPHP4 in clinical molecular monitoring and drug resistance to doxorubicin; furthermore, its leukemogenesis will be essential to explore in future.","query":"cancer"},"36316771":{"ArticleTitle":"A predictive model based on site-specific risk factors of recurrence regions in endometrial cancer patients.","AbstractText":"This study investigated site-specific differences in clinical factors for recurrence in patients who were newly diagnosed and treated for endometrial cancer.

To find out the potential targets of aspirin in BC, we analyzed direct protein targets (DPTs) of aspirin in Drug Bank 5.0. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and signaling pathway of aspirin DPTs were then analyzed subsequently. A detailed analysis of the KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) pathway has shown that aspirin is linked to BC. We identified overexpressed genes in BC comparing with normal samples by Oncomine and genes that interlinked with aspirin target genes in BC by STRING. Firstly, we explored 16 direct protein targets (DPT) of aspirin. We analyzed the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and signaling pathways of aspirin DPT. We found that aspirin is closely associated with a variety of cancers, including BC. Then, we classified mutations in 3 aspirin DPTs (CCND1, MYC and TP53) in BC using the cBio Portal database. In addition, we extracted the top 50 overexpressed genes in bladder cancer by Oncomine and predicted the genes associated with the 3 aspirin DPTs (CCND1, MYC and TP53) in BC by STRING. Finally, 5 exact genes were identified as potential therapeutic targets of aspirin in bladder cancer. The analysis of relevant databases will improve our mechanistic understanding of the role of aspirin in bladder cancer.

In patient 2 redundant skin, severe hearing loss, and hypotonia were observed, and patient 3 presented with hypertelorism and telecanthus. Hyperpigmentation with disseminated pigmentary anomalies is a common trait in all of them. The cytogenetic study was carried out under the strict criteria of analysis, screening 50-100 metaphases from three different tissues, showing trisomy 12 mosaicism in at least one of the three different tissues analyzed.

To find single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) influencing metabolic phenotypes associated with the obesity state, we analyze multiple anthropometric and clinical parameters in a cohort of 790 healthy volunteers and study potential associations with 48 manually curated SNPs, in metabolic genes functionally associated with the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. We identify and validate rs2291007 within a conserved region in the 3'UTR of folliculin-interacting protein FNIP2 that correlates with multiple leanness parameters. The T-to-C variant represents the major allele in Europeans and disrupts an ancestral target sequence of the miRNA miR-181b-5p, thus resulting in increased FNIP2 mRNA levels in cancer cell lines and in peripheral blood from carriers of the C allele. Because the miRNA binding site is conserved across vertebrates, we engineered the T-to-C substitution in the endogenous Fnip2 allele in mice. Primary cells derived from Fnip2 C\/C mice show increased mRNA stability, and more importantly, Fnip2 C\/C mice replicate the decreased adiposity and increased leanness observed in human volunteers. Finally, expression levels of FNIP2 in both human samples and mice negatively associate with leanness parameters, and moreover, are the most important contributor in a multifactorial model of body mass index prediction. We propose that rs2291007 influences human leanness through an evolutionarily conserved modulation of FNIP2 mRNA levels.","query":"cancer"},"36316715":{"ArticleTitle":"The emerging role of exosomes in radiotherapy.","AbstractText":"Presently, more than half of cancer patients receive radiotherapy to cure localized cancer, palliate symptoms, or control the progression of cancer. However, radioresistance and radiation-induced bystander effects (RIBEs) are still challenging problems in cancer treatment. Exosomes, as a kind of extracellular vesicle, have a significant function in mediating and regulating intercellular signaling pathways. An increasing number of studies have shown that radiotherapy can increase exosome secretion and alter exosome cargo. Furthermore, radiation-induced exosomes are involved in the mechanism of radioresistance and RIBEs. Therefore, exosomes hold great promise for clinical application in radiotherapy. In this review, we not only focus on the influence of radiation on exosome biogenesis, secretion and cargoes but also on the mechanism of radiation-induced exosomes in radioresistance and RIBEs, which may expand our insight into the cooperative function of exosomes in radiotherapy.

However, little is known about the roles and the underlying molecular mechanisms of TXN1 in the regulation of hematopoietic stem\/progenitor cells (HSPCs). TXN1 conditional knockout mice (ROSA-CreER-TXN1fl\/fl) and TXN1fl\/fl control mice were used. The mice were treated with tamoxifen and the number and biological functions of HSPCs were measured by flow cytometry, PCR and western blot. Limiting dilution competitive transplantation with sorted HSCs and serial transplantations were performed to assess the effects of TXN1 knockout on HSC self-renewal and long-term reconstitutional capacity. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) was performed to investigate the downstream molecular pathways of TXN1 deletion in murine HSPCs. CRISPR\/Cas9 knockout experiments were performed in vitro in EML murine hematopoietic stem\/progenitor cell line to investigate the effects of TXN1 and\/or TP53 deletion on cell survival, senescence and colony forming units. TP53 protein degradation assay, CHiP PCR and PGL3 firefly\/renilla reporter assay were performed. The effects of TXN1 on various molecular pathways relevant to HSC radiation protection were examined in vitro and in vivo. TXN1-TP53 tumor suppressor axis regulates HSPC biological fitness. Deletion of TXN1 in HSPCs using in vivo and in vitro models activates TP53 signaling pathway, and attenuates HSPC capacity to reconstitute hematopoiesis. Furthermore, we found that knocking out of TXN1 renders HSPCs more sensitive to radiation and treatment with recombinant TXN1 promotes the proliferation and expansion of HSPCs. Our findings suggest that TXN1-TP53 axis acts as a regulatory mechanism in HSPC biological functions. Additionally, our study demonstrates the clinical potential of TXN1 for enhancing hematopoietic recovery in hematopoietic stem cell transplant and protecting HSPCs from radiation injury.","query":"cancer"},"36316711":{"ArticleTitle":"Adeno-associated virus infection and its impact in human health: an overview.","AbstractText":"Discovered as a contaminant of adenovirus stocks in the 1960s, adeno-associated virus (AAV) is a mono-stranded DNA virus that depends on helper factors to replicate.

We presumed that iroquois homeobox 1 (IRX1) to be a hub gene and analyzed its clinical significance. Mouse model of cancer cachexia was established and differences between SAT and VAT were compared. The function of IRX1 on lipid metabolism was clarified by Oil Red O staining, qRT-PCR, and Western blotting in adipocytes. A total of 455 DEGs were screened between SAT and VAT in cachectic patients. Several hub genes were selected and IRX1 was presumed to contribute to the pathological difference between SAT and VAT in cancer cachexia. Patients with higher expression of IRX1 in SAT than VAT revealed significantly higher weight loss, IL-6 and TNF-&#945;, as well as lower BMI, SAT, and VAT area. IRX1 expression in SAT was negatively correlated with SAT area. In cachectic mice, the expression of IRX1 in SAT was significantly higher than that in VAT.

Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been increasingly identified to be associated with tumorigenic processes of CRC. Identifying epigenetically dysregulated lncRNAs and characterizing their effects during carcinogenesis are focuses of cancer research. Differentially methylated loci and expressed lncRNAs were identified by integrating DNA methylome and transcriptome analyses using The Cancer Genome Atlas database. Bisulfite sequencing PCR (BSP) was performed to analyze LIFR-AS1 promoter methylation status. The functional roles of LIFR-AS1 in CRC were determined by in vitro and in vivo experiments. We identified a novel hypermethylated lncRNA, LIFR-AS1, that was downregulated and associated with tumorigenesis, metastasis, and poor prognosis in CRC. High methylation burden of LIFR-AS1 indicated a poor survival of CRC patients. Promoter hypermethylation of LIFR-AS1 in tumor tissues was confirmed by BSP. Functional assays revealed that LIFR-AS1 could competitively bind to hsa-miR-29b-3p, and repressed colon cancer cell proliferation, colony formation and invasion. LIFR-AS1 also inhibited tumor growth in a mouse xenograft model of CRC. Our results showed that the identified DNA methylation-dysregulated lncRNAs may be potential biomarkers and highlighted a role for LIFR-AS1 as a tumor suppressor in CRC.","query":"cancer"},"36316696":{"ArticleTitle":"Association of delayed chemoradiotherapy with elevated Epstein-Barr virus DNA load and adverse clinical outcome in nasopharyngeal carcinoma treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic: a retrospective study.","AbstractText":"To summarize the impact of radiotherapy (RT) and chemotherapy delays on patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Many previous studies have reported an association between the ligation level of the inferior mesenteric artery (IMA) (high or low) and the incidence of AL after rectal cancer surgery. However, we cannot draw a solid conclusion because of the low quality and heterogeneity of those studies. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the impact of the IMA ligation level on the occurrence of AL after minimally invasive anterior resection of rectal cancer. Patients with primary rectal cancer without distant metastases will be included after screening. They will be randomly assigned (1:1) to receive high or low ligation of the IMA. The primary endpoint is AL incidence; secondary endpoints are quality of life; urinary, sexual, and defecatory functions; and 3-year disease-free survival. We hypothesized that the incidence rate of AL would be 15% and 5% in the high- and low-ligation groups, respectively. With a two-sided &#945; of 0.05 and a power of 0.8, the sample size is calculated to be 314 patients (157 per group), considering a 10% dropout rate. Although many studies have compared the short- and long-term outcomes of high and low ligation of the IMA in rectal cancer surgery, it is still debatable. This trial aims to help draw a more solid conclusion regarding the association between the IMA ligation level and AL incidence after rectal cancer surgery.

This retrospective cohort study analysed genomics data for 121,771 patients who had undergone targeted sequencing compiled by the Genomics Evidence Neoplasia Information Exchange (GENIE) or Foundation Medicine (FM). A statistical approach was developed to identify patients with GCV-associated mutational signature (GCVsig) from targeted sequenced data of tumour samples. Cell line exposure models were further used to quantify mutation burden and DNA damage caused by GCV and other antiviral and immunosuppressive drugs. Mutational profiles from 22 of 121,771 patient samples in the GENIE and FM cohorts showed evidence of GCVsig. A diverse range of cancers was represented. All patients with detailed clinical history available had previously undergone solid organ transplantation and received GCV and mycophenolate treatment. RAS hotspot mutations associated with GCVsig were present in 9 of the 22 samples, with all samples harbouring multiple GCV-associated protein-altering mutations in cancer driver genes. In vitro testing in cell lines showed that elevated DNA damage response and GCVsig are uniquely associated with GCV but not acyclovir, a structurally similar antiviral. Combination treatment of GCV with the immunosuppressant, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), increased the misincorporation of GCV in genomic DNA and mutations attributed to GCVsig in cell lines and organoids. In summary, GCV can cause a diverse range of cancers. Its mutagenicity may be potentiated by other therapies, such as mycophenolate, commonly co-prescribed with GCV for post-transplant patients. Further investigation of the optimal use of these drugs could help reduce GCV-associated mutagenesis in post-transplant patients.","query":"cancer"},"36316684":{"ArticleTitle":"CD44 is a prognostic biomarker and correlated with immune infiltrates in gastric cancer.","AbstractText":"Gastric carcinoma is the most common malignant tumour of the human digestive system worldwide.

Differences in CD44 between gastric cancer cell lines and normal cells were detected by real-time PCR, and the HPA database was used to analyse the differential expression of CD44 protein in gastric cancer and normal tissues. The effect of CD44 on the proliferation and migration of gastric cancer cells was detected by CCK8 and transwell assays. UALCAN was used to analyse the relationship between CD44 expression and clinical parameters, and the Kaplan&#8210;Meier Plotter was used to evaluate the prognostic value, including overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS) and post-progression survival (PPS). The CD44 gene and protein interaction network was constructed by using the Linked Omics, GeneMANIA, STRING and DisGeNET databases. GO and KEGG analyses and GSEA of CD44 were performed by using R language. The correlation between CD44 and immune infiltration was explored by using the TIMER, CIBERSORT and GEPIA databases. CD44 is highly expressed in gastric cancer compared with normal tissues. Inhibition of proliferation and migration of gastric cancer cells after CD44 knockdown was observed. The UALCAN database showed that CD44 was independent of sex in gastric cancer but correlated with cancer stage and lymph node metastasis. Kaplan&#8210;Meier Plotter online analysis showed that OS, PFS and PPS were prolonged in the CD44 low-expression group. GO and KEGG analyses and GSEA results showed that CD44 was mainly located in the endoplasmic reticulum and the extracellular matrix containing collagen, which was mainly involved in protein digestion and absorption.

This paper presents the costing tool methods as well as the results from the pilot in Tanzania. The C4P tool estimates the incremental costs of cervical cancer prevention and control programmes. It estimates the financial (monetary costs to the government) and economic costs (opportunity costs). For the pilot, the study team collected data on costs and programme assumptions for human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination of 14-year-old girls and scaling up of cervical cancer screening (visual inspection with acetic acid and HPV-DNA testing) and treatment for women for 2020-2024. Assumptions were made on how vaccination coverage would increase over the 5 years as well as developing additional screening and treatment capacity through health personnel training and infrastructure strengthening. The total financial and economic costs of the comprehensive programme during 2020-2024 are projected to be US$68 million and US$124 million, respectively. The financial and economic costs of a fully immunized girl with HPV vaccine are estimated to be US$6.68 and US$17.31, respectively, while the costs per woman screened for cervical cancer are, on average, US$4.02 and US$5.83, respectively; US$6.44 and US$9.37 for pre-cancer treatment, respectively; and US$101 and US$107 for diagnosis of invasive cancer, respectively. The cost of treating and managing invasive cancer range from US$7.05 and US$7.83 for outpatient palliative care to US$800.21 and US$893.80 for radiotherapy, respectively.

STEAP2 expression in peritumoral tissues, osteosarcoma, benign fibrous dysplasia, osteosarcoma cells, normal osteoblastic hFOB cells, and various invasive subclones was evaluated using IHC, ICC, and qRT-PCR. We also evaluated the association between STEAP2 expression and disease outcome using Kaplan-Meier analyses and then investigated STEAP2 regulation and its functional effects using both in vitro and in vivo assays. The results revealed that the upregulation of STEAP2 in osteosarcoma tissues positively correlated with both the malignant osteosarcoma phenotype and poor patient outcomes. In addition, STEAP2 expression induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) via the PI3K\/AKT\/mTOR axis and facilitated osteosarcoma cell infiltration and migration. Changes in EFEMP2 expression resulted in correlating changes in STEAP2 expression, with EFEMP2-overexpressing osteosarcoma cells exhibiting a less invasive phenotype and reduced EMT following STEAP2 inhibition. It is also worth noting that although EFEMP2 overexpression activated the PI3K\/AKT\/mTOR pathway promoting EMT, it did not affect osteosarcoma cells in which STEAP2 or Akt was knocked down. Thus, we can conclude that STEAP2 acts as an oncogene in osteosarcoma progression, while EFEMP2 enables PI3K\/AKT\/mTOR axis initiation and EMT by partly targeting STEAP2, thereby facilitating osteosarcoma cell infiltration and migration.","query":"cancer"},"36316630":{"ArticleTitle":"Drug-related adverse events potentially predict the efficacy of apatinib on advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.","AbstractText":"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide every year, and most HCC patients are diagnosed with advanced disease and can only receive systemic treatment.

Interviews with providers underwent qualitative analysis using grounded theory to identify themes related to antidiabetic drug prescribing. A provider survey used vignettes and direct questions to quantitatively assess prescribers' knowledge and preferences. A retrospective cohort analysis of real-world prescribing data assessed the external validity of the interview and survey findings. Primary care physicians, endocrinologists, nurse-practitioners, and physicians' assistants were eligible for interviews; primary care physicians and endocrinologists were eligible for the survey; prescribing data were derived from adult patients with serum creatinine data. Interviews were qualitative; for the survey and retrospective cohort, proportion of patients receiving metformin was the primary outcome. Interviews with 9 providers identified a theme of uncertainty about guidelines for prescribing antidiabetic drugs in patients with T2D and CKD. The survey had 105 respondents: 74 primary care providers and 31 endocrinologists. Metformin was the most common choice for patients with T2D and CKD. Compared to primary care providers, endocrinologists were less likely to prescribe metformin at levels of kidney function at which it is contraindicated and more likely to correctly answer a question about metformin's contraindications (71% versus 41%) (p < .05). Real-world data were consistent with survey findings, and further showed low rates of use of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (<10%) in patients with eGFR below 60 ml\/min\/1.73m2.

The purpose of this study is to assess the incidence and clinicopathologic factors associated with risk of SPCs in BC survivors. We analyzed 171, 311 women with early-stage primary BC diagnosed between January 2000 and December 2015 from the Medicare-linked Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER-Medicare) database. SPC was defined as any diagnosis of malignancy occurring within the study period and at least 6 months after primary BC diagnosis. Univariate analyses compared baseline characteristics between those who developed a SPC and those who did not. We evaluated the cause-specific hazard of developing a SPC in the presence of death as a competing risk. Of the study cohort, 21,510 (13%) of BC survivors developed a SPC and BC was the most common SPC type (28%). The median time to SPC was 44&#160;months. Women who were white, older, and with fewer comorbidities were more likely to develop a SPC. While statins [hazard ratio (HR) 1.066 (1.023-1.110)] and anti-hypertensives [HR 1.569 (1.512-1.627)] increased the hazard of developing a SPC, aromatase inhibitor therapy [HR 0.620 (0.573-0.671)] and bisphosphonates [HR 0.905 (0.857-0.956)] were associated with a decreased hazard of developing any SPC, including non-breast SPCs.

Based on the independent prognostic factors, a nomogram was constructed to predict OS in HNSCC patients with DM. The C-index values of the nomogram were 0.713 in the training cohort and 0.674 in the validation cohort, respectively. The calibration curves and DCA also indicated the good predictability of the nomogram. Finally, a risk classification system was built and it revealed a statistically significant difference among the three groups of patients according to the nomogram scores. Factors associated with the overall survival of HNSCC patients with DM were found. According to the identified factors, we generated a nomogram and risk classification system to predict the OS of patients with initially diagnosed HNSCC with DM.

Although two E3s, CRL2VHL and CRL4CRBN, frequently assemble with proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs) to attach lysine-48 (K48)-linked ubiquitin chains, the diversity of the ubiquitin code used for chemically induced degradation is largely unknown. Here we show that the efficacy of cIAP1-targeting degraders depends on the K63-specific E2 enzyme UBE2N. UBE2N promotes degradation of cIAP1 induced by cIAP1 ligands and subsequent cancer cell apoptosis. Mechanistically, UBE2N-catalyzed K63-linked ubiquitin chains facilitate assembly of highly complex K48\/K63 and K11\/K48 branched ubiquitin chains, thereby recruiting p97\/VCP, UCH37 and the proteasome. Degradation of neo-substrates directed by cIAP1-recruiting PROTACs also depends on UBE2N.

There is increasing evidence that glycolysis plays vital roles in tumorigenesis, tumor invasion, immune evasion, chemoresistance, and metastasis. However, a comprehensive analysis of the diagnostic and prognostic significance of glycolysis in TNBC is lacking. Transcriptomic and clinical data of TNBC patients were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Molecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer International Consortium (METABRIC) databases, respectively. Glycolysis-related genes (GRGs) were collected from the Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB). Differential comparative analysis was performed to obtain the differentially expressed (DE)-GRGs associated with TNBC. Based on the DE-GRGs, a glycolysis-related risk signature was established using Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selector Operation (LASSO) and multivariable Cox regression analyses. The prognostic value, tumor microenvironment, mutation status, and chemotherapy response of different risk groups were analyzed. An independent cohort from the METABRIC database was used for external validation. Furthermore, the expression patterns of five genes derived from the prognostic model were validated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). The glycolysis-related prognostic signature included five genes (IFNG, ACSS2, IRS2, GFUS, and GAL3ST1) and predicted the prognosis of TNBC patients independent of clinical factors (p&#8201;<&#8201;0.05). Patients were divided into high- and low-risk groups based on the median risk score. Compared to low-risk TNBC patients, high-risk patients had significantly decreased overall survival (HR&#8201;=&#8201;2.718, p&#8201;<&#8201;0.001). Receiver operating characteristic and calibration curves demonstrated that the model had high performance in terms of predicting survival and risk stratification. The results remained consistent after external verification. Additionally, the tumor immune microenvironment significantly differed between the risk groups. Low-risk TNBC patients had a better immunotherapy response than high-risk patients. High-risk TNBC patients with a poor prognosis may benefit from targeted therapy. This study developed a novel glycolysis and prognosis-related (GRP) signature based on GRGs to predict the prognosis of TNBC patients, and may aid clinical decision-making for these patients.","query":"cancer"},"36316541":{"ArticleTitle":"Establishment, characterization and functional testing of two novel ex vivo extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma (EMC) cell models.","AbstractText":"Extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma (EMC) is a malignant mesenchymal neoplasm of uncertain differentiation as classified by the WHO Classification of Tumours 2020.

The molecular consequences of the NR4A3 gene fusions are not yet fully elucidated as well-characterized ex vivo cell models for EMC are lacking. Patient-derived ex vivo models are important and essential tools for investigating disease mechanisms associated with diseases that are rare, that exhibit poor prognosis and for the identification of potential novel treatment options. We established two novel EMC ex vivo models (USZ20-EMC1 and USZ22-EMC2) for functional testing and research purposes. USZ20-EMC1 and USZ22-EMC2 were established and maintained as sarco-sphere cell models for several months in culture. The cells were molecularly characterized using DNA sequencing and methylation profiling. Both cell models represent their native tumor tissue as confirmed by histomorphology and their molecular profiles, suggesting that native tumor cell function can be recapitulated in the ex vivo models. Using a functional screening approach, novel anti-cancer drug sensitivities including potential synergistic combinations were identified. In conclusion, two novel EMC ex vivo cell models (USZ20-EMC1 and USZ22-EMC2) were successfully established and characterized from native tumor tissues.

Mechanistically, SBSN activated NF-&#954;B signaling by interacting with annexin A1, which further induced Lys63-linked and Met1-linear polyubiquitination of NF-&#954;B essential modulator (NEMO). In conclusion, the communication of SBSN-containing EVs within glioma cells drives the formation and development of tumors by activating NF-&#954;B pathway, which may provide potential therapeutic target for clinical intervention in glioma.","query":"cancer"},"36316442":{"ArticleTitle":"Targeting the cholesterol-ROR&#945;\/&#947; axis inhibits colorectal cancer progression through degrading c-myc.","AbstractText":"Dysregulated cholesterol metabolism is a hallmark of colorectal cancer (CRC). However, the usage of cholesterol-lowering agents seemed to have no benefit in CRC patients. In this study, we focused on the cholesterol-nuclear receptors (NRs) axis as a strategy. Cholesterol and its derivatives work as ligands for different nuclear receptors, thus promoting cancer progression. The key NR downstream of cholesterol in CRC is unknown. Here, we treated CRC cells with a cholesterol-lowering agent and lipoprotein-depleted conditioned medium, and then detected the change of the putative NRs. The results revealed that ROR&#945;\/&#947; (Retinoic acid receptor-related Orphan Receptor &#945;\/&#947;) levels exhibited the most obvious increases in CRC cells subjected them to cholesterol deprivation. ROR&#945;\/&#947; agonists significantly inhibited CRC cells proliferation and migration in vitro and in vivo. Also, ROR&#945;\/&#947; overexpression repressed CRC cells proliferation and migration in vitro and in vivo and ROR&#945;\/&#947; knockdown promoted it. Mechanistically, ROR&#945;\/&#947; agonists promoted c-myc degradation by activating the transcription of the ubiquitinase NEDD4.

The mechanisms underlying 5-FU toxicity are debated, limiting the development of strategies to improve its efficacy. How fundamental aspects of cancer, such as driver mutations and phenotypic heterogeneity, relate to the 5-FU response remains obscure. This largely relies on the limited number of studies performed in pre-clinical models able to recapitulate the key features of CRC. Here, we analyzed the 5-FU response in patient-derived organoids that reproduce the different stages of CRC. We find that 5-FU induces pyrimidine imbalance, which leads to DNA damage and cell death in the actively proliferating cancer cells deficient in p53. Importantly, p53-deficiency leads to cell death due to impaired cell cycle arrest. Moreover, we find that targeting the Warburg effect in KRASG12D glycolytic tumor organoids enhances 5-FU toxicity by further altering the nucleotide pool and, importantly, without affecting non-transformed WT cells. Thus, p53 emerges as an important factor in determining the 5-FU response, and targeting cancer metabolism in combination with replication stress-inducing chemotherapies emerges as a promising strategy for CRC treatment.","query":"cancer"},"36316438":{"ArticleTitle":"Positive surgical margin's impact on short-term oncological prognosis after robot-assisted partial nephrectomy (MARGINS study: UroCCR no 96).","AbstractText":"The oncological impact of positive surgical margins (PSM) after robot-assisted partial nephrectomy (RAPN) is still under debate.

AtDCS was seen to significantly reduced GABA+ and increase brain activation in the left DLPFC as compared to sham stimulation. Task performance was worse in the aTDCS group during stimulation but no group differences in behavioural outcomes were observed at the end of stimulation.

A complex neuroendocrine response to an acute exercise session helps to maintain circulating levels of glucose in a fairly tight range in healthy individuals, while several abnormal physiological processes and limitations of insulin therapy limit the capacity of people with T1DM to exercise in a normoglycaemic state. Knowledge of the acute and chronic effects of exercise and regular physical activity is critical for the formulation of clinical strategies for the management of insulin and nutrition for active patients with T1DM. Emerging diabetes-related technologies, such as continuous glucose monitors, automated insulin delivery systems and the administration of solubilized glucagon, are demonstrating efficacy for preserving glucose homeostasis during and after exercise in this population of patients.

SORT LNPs are modular and can be prepared using scalable, synthetic chemistry and established engineering formulation methods. This protocol provides detailed procedures, including the synthesis of a representative ionizable cationic lipid, preparation of multiple classes of SORT LNPs by pipette, vortex and microfluidic mixing methods, physical characterization, and in vitro\/in vivo mRNA delivery evaluation. Depending on the scale of the experiments, the synthesis of the ionizable lipid requires 4-6 d; LNPs can be formulated within several hours; LNP characterization can be completed in 2-4 h; and in vitro\/in vivo evaluation studies require 1-14 d, depending on the design and application. Our strategy offers a versatile and practical method for rationally designing nanoparticles that accurately target specific organs. The SORT LNPs generated as described in this protocol can therefore be applied to multiple classes of LNP systems for therapeutic nucleic acid delivery and facilitate the development of protein replacement and genetic medicines in target tissues.

In-depth exploration of the relationship between various influencing factors of osteosarcoma is very important for screening promising therapeutic targets. This study used multivariate COX regression analysis to select the hypoxia genes SLC2A1 and FBP1 in patients with osteosarcoma, and used the expression of these two genes to divide the patients with osteosarcoma into high-risk and low-risk groups. Then, we first constructed a prognostic model based on the patient's risk value and compared the survival difference between the high expression group and the low expression group. Second, in the high expression group and the low expression group, compare the differences in tumor invasion and inflammatory gene expression between the two groups of immune cells. Finally, the ferroptosis-related genes with differences between the high expression group and the low expression group were screened, and the correlation between these genes was analyzed. In the high-risk group, immune cells with higher tumor invasiveness, macrophages M0 and immune cells with lower invasiveness included: mast cell resting, regulatory T cells (Tregs) and monocytes. Finally, among genes related to ferroptosis, we found AKR1C2, AKR1C1 and ALOX15 that may be related to hypoxia. These ferroptosis-related genes were discovered for the first time in osteosarcoma. Among them, the hypoxia gene FBP1 is positively correlated with the ferroptosis genes AKR1C1 and ALOX15, and the hypoxia gene SLC2A1 is negatively correlated with the ferroptosis genes AKR1C2, AKR1C1 and ALOX15. This study constructed a prognostic model based on hypoxia-related genes SLC2A1 and FBP1 in patients with osteosarcoma, and explored their correlation with immune cells, inflammatory markers and ferroptosis-related genes.

This multi-center retrospective study analyzed 53 cases of recurrent or metastatic inoperable HNSCC who had progressed or recurred after undergoing standard radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy treated with apatinib from March 2017 to August 2021. Patients continued apatinib until the time of disease progression or onset of intolerable adverse events.

The oxysterol (27HC) is produced via oxidation by sterol 27-hydroxylase (CYP27A1) and metabolized via oxysterol 7a-hydroxylase (CYP7B1) for bile acid synthesis in the liver. A previous study has demonstrated that treatment with the alternative Estrogen receptor alpha (ER&#945;) ligand 27HC induces ER&#945;-dependent hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) mobilization. In addition, Cyp27a1-deficient mice demonstrate significantly reduced 27HC levels and HSC mobilization. Here, we report that exogenous 27HC treatment leads to a substantial reduction in the hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) population owing to significantly increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and apoptosis in the bone marrow (BM). However, 27HC does not influence the population of mature hematopoietic cells in the BM. Furthermore, exogenous 27HC treatment suppresses cell growth and promotes ROS production and apoptosis in leukemic cells. Moreover, acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients with high CYP7B1 expression (expected to have inhibition of 27HC) had significantly shorter survival than those with low CYP7B1 expression (expected to have an elevation of 27HC). Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA seq) analysis revealed that the expression of CYP7B1 was significantly increased in AML patients. Thus, our study suggests that 27HC may serve as a potent agent for regulating pools of HSPCs and may have an application as a novel therapeutic target for hematological malignancies. Collectively, pharmacological inhibition of CYP7B1 (expected to have an elevation of 27HC) would potentially have fewer long-term hematological side effects, particularly when used in combination with chemotherapy or radiation for the treatment of leukemia patients.","query":"cancer"},"36316326":{"ArticleTitle":"DNAJA1- and conformational mutant p53-dependent inhibition of cancer cell migration by a novel compound identified through a virtual screen.","AbstractText":"Cancers are frequently addicted to oncogenic missense mutant p53 (mutp53).

However, strategies to deplete mutp53 are not well-established, and no HSP40\/JDPs inhibitors are clinically available. To identify compounds that bind to DNAJA1 and induce mutp53 degradation, we performed an in silico docking study of ~10 million of compounds from the ZINC database for the J-domain of DNAJA1. A compound 7-3 was identified, and its analogue A11 effectively reduced the levels of DNAJA1 and conformational mutp53 with minimal effects on the levels of wild-type p53 and DNA-contact mutp53. A11 suppressed migration and filopodia formation in a manner dependent on DNAJA1 and conformational mutp53. A mutant DNAJA1 with alanine mutations at predicted amino acids (tyrosine 7, lysine 44, and glutamine 47) failed to bind to A11. Cells expressing the mutant DNAJA1 became insensitive to A11-mediated depletion of DNAJA1 and mutp53 as well as A11-mediated inhibition of cell migration. Thus, A11 is the first HSP40\/JDP inhibitor that has not been previously characterized for depleting DNAJA1 and subsequently conformational mutp53, leading to inhibition of cancer cell migration.

In this study, after screening a series of curcumin derivatives synthesized in our laboratory, we found that (3E,5E)-1-methyl-3-(4-hydroxybenzylidene)-5-(3-indolymethylene)-piperidine-4-one (CUR5g) selectively inhibited autophagosome degradation in cancer cells by blocking autophagosome-lysosome fusion. CUR5g did not affect the lysosomal pH and proteolytic function, nor did it disturb cytoskeleton. CUR5g blocked the recruitment of STX17, a soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) protein, to autophagosomes via a UVRAG-dependent mechanism, resulting in the inability of autophagosomes to fuse with lysosomes.

Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) is often used to mitigate neutropenia after CAR T, but there is no consensus recommended strategy due to hypothesized, but largely unknown risks of exacerbating toxicities. To investigate the impact of G-CSF, we retrospectively analyzed 197 patients treated with anti-CD19 CAR T for lymphoma and 47 patients treated with anti-BCMA CAR T for multiple myeloma. In lymphoma, 140 patients (71%) received prophylactic G-CSF before CAR T (mostly pegylated G-CSF) and were compared with 57 patients (29%) treated with G-CSF after CAR T or not exposed. Prophylactic G-CSF was associated with faster neutrophil recovery (3 vs. 4 days, P&#8201;<&#8201;0.01) but did not reduce recurrent neutropenia later. Prophylactic G-CSF was associated with increased grade &#8805;2 CRS (HR 2.15, 95% CI 1.11-4.18, P&#8201;=&#8201;0.02), but not ICANS. In multiple myeloma, prophylactic G-CSF was not used; patients were stratified by early G-CSF exposure (&#8804;2 days vs. &#8805;3 days after CAR T or no exposure), with no significant difference in toxicities.

O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) mediated DNA damage repair is a key mechanism for TMZ resistance. However, MGMT-null GBM patients remain resistant to TMZ, and the process for resistance evolution is largely unknown. Here, we developed an acquired TMZ resistant xenograft model using serial implantation of MGMT-hypermethylated U87 cells, allowing the extraction of stable, TMZ resistant (TMZ-R) tumors and primary cells. The derived tumors and cells exhibited stable multidrug resistance both in vitro and in vivo. Functional experiments, as well as single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), indicated that TMZ treatment induced cellular heterogeneity including quiescent cancer stem cells (CSCs) in TMZ-R tumors. A subset of these were labeled by NES+\/SOX2+\/CADM1+ and demonstrated significant advantages for drug resistance. Further study revealed that Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) deficiency and diminished downstream signaling may confer this triple positive CSCs subgroup's quiescent phenotypes and chemoresistance. Continuous EGF treatment improved the chemosensitivity of TMZ-R cells both in vitro and in vivo, mechanically reversing cell cycle arrest and reduced drug uptake. Further, EGF treatment of TMZ-R tumors favorably normalized the response to TMZ in combination therapy. Here, we characterize a unique subgroup of CSCs in MGMT-null experimental glioblastoma, identifying EGF&#8201;+&#8201;TMZ therapy as a potential strategy to overcome cellular quiescence and TMZ resistance, likely endowed by deficient EGFR signaling.","query":"cancer"},"36316305":{"ArticleTitle":"BRCA mutational status shapes the stromal microenvironment of pancreatic cancer linking clusterin expression in cancer associated fibroblasts with HSF1 signaling.","AbstractText":"Tumors initiate by mutations in cancer cells, and progress through interactions of the cancer cells with non-malignant cells of the tumor microenvironment. Major players in the tumor microenvironment are cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), which support tumor malignancy, and comprise up to 90% of the tumor mass in pancreatic cancer. CAFs are transcriptionally rewired by cancer cells. Whether this rewiring is differentially affected by different mutations in cancer cells is largely unknown. Here we address this question by dissecting the stromal landscape of BRCA-mutated and BRCA Wild-type pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. We comprehensively analyze pancreatic cancer samples from 42 patients, revealing different CAF subtype compositions in germline BRCA-mutated vs. BRCA Wild-type tumors. In particular, we detect an increase in a subset of immune-regulatory clusterin-positive CAFs in BRCA-mutated tumors. Using cancer organoids and mouse models we show that this process is mediated through activation of heat-shock factor 1, the transcriptional regulator of clusterin. Our findings unravel a dimension of stromal heterogeneity influenced by germline mutations in cancer cells, with direct implications for clinical research.","query":"cancer"},"36316301":{"ArticleTitle":"Hyperspectral imaging for tumor segmentation on pigmented skin lesions.","AbstractText":"SignificanceMalignant skin tumors, which include melanoma and nonmelanoma skin cancers, are the most prevalent type of malignant tumor. Gross pathology of pigmented skin lesions (PSL) remains manual, time-consuming, and heavily dependent on the expertise of the medical personnel. Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) can assist in the detection of tumors and evaluate the status of tumor margins by their spectral signatures.AimTumor segmentation of medical HSI data is a research field. The goal of this study is to propose a framework for HSI-based tumor segmentation of PSL.ApproachAn HSI dataset of 28 PSL was prepared. Two frameworks for data preprocessing and tumor segmentation were proposed. Models based on machine learning and deep learning were used at the core of each framework.ResultsCross-validation performance showed that pixel-wise processing achieves higher segmentation performance, in terms of the Jaccard coefficient. Simultaneous use of spatio-spectral features produced more comprehensive tumor masks. A three-dimensional Xception-based network achieved performance similar to state-of-the-art networks while allowing for more detailed detection of the tumor border.ConclusionsGood performance was achieved for melanocytic lesions, but margins were difficult to detect in some cases of basal cell carcinoma. The frameworks proposed in this study could be further improved for robustness against different pathologies and detailed delineation of tissue margins to facilitate computer-assisted diagnosis during gross pathology.","query":"cancer"},"36316300":{"ArticleTitle":"Metabolism, Pharmacokinetics and Bioavailability of Yuanhuacine in Rat Using Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry.","AbstractText":"Yuanhuacine is a daphne-type diterpene ortho-ester and originated from genkwa flos.

The metabolic profile of yuanhuacine was obtained from rat plasma, urine, and feces using an ultra-high performance liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Total 7 metabolites were detected, and the proposed metabolic pathways involved oxidation and glucuronidation. A simple and sensitive ultra-high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry method was developed for determination of yuanhuacine in rat plasma. The linear range of yuanhuacine was 1-1000 ng\/mL (R2 = 0.998). The intra- and inter-precision (CV%) of the assay were 3.86%-6.18% and 2.65%-5.75%, and the intra- and inter-accuracy (RE%) were -3.83%-4.77% and -3.03%-5.11%, respectively.

Nanomedicines can be utilized to convert the non-immunogenic \"cold\" tumors to immunogenic \"hot\" tumors via inducing immunogenic cell death (ICD), thereby promoting the antitumor immune response. Some nanomedicines that can produce local heat and reactive oxygen species upon the stimulation of electromagnetic energy are the main candidates for inducing the ICD effect. However, their applications are often restricted due to the poor tissue penetration depths of electromagnetic energy, such as light. By contrast, ultrasound, X-ray, alternating magnetic field, and microwave show excellent tissue penetration depths and thereby can be used for sonodynamic therapy, radiotherapy, magnetic hyperthermia therapy, and microwave ablation therapy, all of which can effectively induce ICD. Herein, the combination of deep-tissue electromagnetic energy with nanomedicines for inducing ICD and cancer immunotherapy are summarized. In particular, the designs of nanomedicines to amplify ICD effect in the presence of deep-tissue electromagnetic energy and sensitize tumors to various immunotherapies will be discussed.

Up to one-third of the disease is dia-gnosed in women younger than 45 years of age, who may still have open reproductive plans. Therefore, in recent years, there has been increasing interest in performing fertility-sparing treatment (FST), which aims to preserve fertility while achieving the same oncologic safety as radical surgical treatment. To summarize the current knowledge on FST in women with early stages of cervical cancer. Review of published literature on the topic using medical databases. FST is reserved for patients with HPV-associated cervical cancer up to stage IB with negative nodes. Conservative procedures (conization and simple vaginal trachelectomy) and radical trachelectomy are available. Conservative procedures for tumors 2cm have comparable oncological outcomes as radical treatment with a significantly lower rate of perinatological complications. On average, 55% of patients become pregnant after treatment and of these, on average 70% give birth to a live newborn. Approximately 38% of deliveries are preterm, most often after radical trachelectomy. The most common postoperative complication with direct impact on fertility is cervical stenosis. In a selected group of patients with tumors up to 2cm, FST is a safe procedure with good perinatological outcomes. However, it remains unclear whether it is safe to offer this treatment to patients with larger tumors. The use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by conservative surgery is a promising approach but requires further validation in clinical trials.","query":"cancer"},"36316218":{"ArticleTitle":"Female fertility preservation in cancer patients.","AbstractText":"Fertility preservation in cancer patients or oncofertility is a relatively new trend in modern medicine.

While opioid use was strongly associated with participants reporting higher scores, this association was not seen in those patients receiving specialist palliative care. Conclusions: Constipation remains a clinical problem in Irish cancer centres. Despite increased opioid use, patients receiving specialist palliative care were more likely to take laxatives and reported less constipation. Specialist palliative care practice should be studied in order to identify what are the transferable 'ingredients' of effective constipation management.","query":"cancer"},"36316114":{"ArticleTitle":"Apatinib as a Third-Line Treatment for HER2-Positive Metastatic Gastric Cancer: A Multi-Center Single-Arm Cohort Study.","AbstractText":"Treatment options are limited after the failure of first-and second-line treatments in patients with HER2+ metastatic gastric cancer (mGC). The present study aimed to explore the efficacy, safety, and prognostic factors of apatinib efficacy as a third-line therapy for patients with human epithelial growth factor receptor 2-positive (HER2+) mGC. A total of 59 HER2+ mGC patients who received apatinib as third-line therapy were retrospectively enrolled in this two-center, single-arm, cohort study; the clinical response, survival data, and adverse events were retrieved. The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 5.2 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.9-6.5), and the median overall survival (OS) was 8.2 months (95% CI, 6.6-9.8) Furthermore, forward stepwise multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that a higher Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status score and multiple metastases were independently correlated with decreased PFS and OS (both P<0.05). The main adverse events were leukopenia (45.8%), hypertension (44.1%), thrombocytopenia (39.0%), hand-foot syndrome (37.3%), and elevated transaminase (33.9%). Grade 3 adverse events mainly included hypertension (5.1%) and neutropenia (5.1%); grade 4 adverse events did not occur. Apatinib is efficient and well tolerated in patients with HER2+ mGC as a third-line treatment, suggesting that it may be a candidate of choice for these patients.","query":"cancer"},"36316113":{"ArticleTitle":"Safe Discharge Criteria After Curative Gastrectomy for Gastric Cancer.","AbstractText":"This study aimed to investigate the relationship between clinical and laboratory parameters and complication status to predict which patients can be safely discharged from the hospital on the third postoperative day (POD).

The third POD vital signs, laboratory data, and details of the course after surgery were collected. Patients with grade II or higher complications after the third POD were considered unsuitable for early discharge. The performance metrics were calculated for all algorithm parameters. The proposed algorithm was tested using a validation dataset of consecutive patients from the same center. Of 1,438 patients in the study cohort, 142 (9.9%) were considered unsuitable for early discharge. C-reactive protein level, body temperature, pulse rate, and neutrophil count had good performance metrics and were determined to be independent prognostic factors. An algorithm consisting of these 4 parameters had a negative predictive value (NPV) of 95.9% (95% confidence interval [CI], 94.2-97.3), sensitivity of 80.3% (95% CI, 72.8-86.5), and specificity of 51.1% (95% CI, 48.3-53.8). Only 28 (1.9%) patients in the study cohort were classified as false negatives. In the validation dataset, the NPV was 93.7%, sensitivity was 66%, and 3.3% (17\/512) of patients were classified as false negatives. Simple clinical and laboratory parameters obtained on the third POD can be used when making decisions regarding the safe early discharge of patients who underwent gastrectomy.","query":"cancer"},"36316112":{"ArticleTitle":"Endoscopic Findings and Treatment of Gastric Neoplasms in Familial Adenomatous Polyposis.","AbstractText":"Gastric neoplasia is a common manifestation of familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP).

A total of 35 patients diagnosed with FAP, including nine patients from four pedigrees who underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), were investigated regarding patient characteristics, GN morphology, and treatment outcomes. Twenty-one patients (60.0%) had 38 GNs; 33 (86.8%) and 5 (13.2%) were histologically diagnosed with adenocarcinoma and adenoma, respectively. There were no specific patient characteristics related to GNs. Nodule-type GNs were more prevalent in patients with FGP than without (52.2% vs. 0.0%, P=0.002) in the upper body of the stomach. Conversely, depressed-type GNs were fewer in patients with FGPsis than in those without (13.0% vs. 73.3%, P<0.001). Slightly elevated-type GNs were observed in both groups (34.8% vs. 20.0%, P=0.538). Even within pedigrees, the background gastric mucosa and types of GNs varied. In total, 24 GNs were treated with endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) and eight with endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR). EMR was selected for GNs with FGPsis because of the technical difficulty of ESD, resulting in a lower en bloc resection rate (62.5% vs. 100%, P=0.014). Our study indicates the necessity of routine EGD surveillance in patients diagnosed with FAP. Notably, the morphology and location of GNs differed between patients with and without FGPsis.

The genotyping study included 542 patients with GC and healthy controls. Generalized linear models were used for the risk and clinicopathological association analyses. Survival analysis was performed using the Kaplan-Meier method. The binding of candidate miRs was analyzed using a luciferase reporter assay. The PLK2 Crs15009-Crs963615 haplotype was under-represented in the GC group compared to that in the control group (Pcorr=0.050). Male patients with the PLK2 rs963615 CT genotype had a lower risk of GC, whereas female patients had a higher risk (P=0.023; P=0.026).

The first group satisfied the absolute indication for ESD (n=18), the second group satisfied the expanded indications for ESD (n=34), and the last group satisfied the beyond indication (n=58). The number of occurrences of EGM in each group was 1 (5.6%), 3 (8.8%), and 3 (5.2%), respectively.

The targets of SETDB1 were predicted by AnimalTFDB, and dual-luciferase reporter assay was used for confirming the combination of Sp1, &#946;-catenin, and SETDB1. HGC27 or AGS cells (1&#215;106 cells\/mouse) were injected into mice via the caudal vein for GC model establishment. The level of Ki67 was detected using immunohistochemistry, and hematoxylin and eosin staining was performed for evaluating tumor metastasis in mice with GC. HPGD was inhibited, while the protein levels of Sp1, &#946;-catenin, and SETDB1 were up-regulated in GC tissues and cell lines. HPGD overexpression or SETDB1 silencing inhibited the proliferation, invasion, and migration of GC cells, and Sp1 regulated the proliferation, invasion, and migration of GC cells in a &#946;-catenin-dependent manner. Furthermore, HPGD served as a target of SETDB1, and it was negatively regulated by SETDB1; additionally, Sp1 and &#946;-catenin bound to the SETDB1 promoter and negatively regulated HPGD expression.

Depletion of L-Arg has detrimental consequences for T cells and leads to T-cell dysfunction and suppression of anticancer immune responses. Previous work from our group has demonstrated the presence of proinflammatory ARG2-specific CD4 T cells that inhibited tumor growth in murine models on activation with ARG2-derived peptides. In this study, we investigated the natural occurrence of ARG2-specific CD8 T cells in both healthy donors (HDs) and patients with cancer, along with their immunomodulatory capabilities in the context of the TME. A library of 15 major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I-restricted ARG2-derived peptides were screened in HD peripheral blood mononuclear cells using interferon gamma (IFN-&#947;) ELISPOT. ARG2-specific CD8 T-cell responses were identified using intracellular cytokine staining and ARG2-specific CD8 T-cell cultures were established by enrichment and rapid expansion following in vitro peptide stimulation. The reactivity of the cultures toward ARG2-expressing cells, including cancer cell lines and activated regulatory T cells (Tregs), was assessed using IFN-&#947; ELISPOT and a chromium release assay. The Treg signature was validated based on proliferation suppression assays, flow cytometry and quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR). In addition, vaccinations with ARG2-derived epitopes were performed in the murine Pan02 tumor model, and induction of ARG2-specific T-cell responses was evaluated with IFN-&#947; ELISPOT. RNAseq and subsequent GO-term and ImmuCC analysis was performed on the tumor tissue. We describe the existence of ARG2-specific CD8+ T cells and demonstrate these CD8+ T-cell responses in both HDs and patients with cancer. ARG2-specific T cells recognize and react to an ARG2-derived peptide presented in the context of HLA-B8 and exert their cytotoxic function against cancer cells with endogenous ARG2 expression. We demonstrate that ARG2-specific T cells can specifically recognize and react to activated Tregs with high ARG2 expression. Finally, we observe tumor growth suppression and antitumorigenic immunomodulation following ARG2 vaccination in an in vivo setting. These findings highlight the ability of ARG2-specific T cells to modulate the immunosuppressive TME and suggest that ARG2-based immunomodulatory vaccines may be an interesting option for cancer immunotherapy.","query":"cancer"},"36316061":{"ArticleTitle":"First-in-human phase I\/II, open-label study of the anti-OX40 agonist INCAGN01949 in patients with advanced solid tumors.","AbstractText":"OX40 is a costimulatory receptor upregulated on antigen-activated T cells and constitutively expressed on regulatory T cells (Tregs).

Patients received INCAGN01949 monotherapy (7-1400 mg) in 14-day cycles while deriving benefit. Safety measures, clinical activity, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamic effects were assessed and summarized with descriptive statistics. Eighty-seven patients were enrolled; most common tumor types were colorectal (17.2%), ovarian (8.0%), and non-small cell lung (6.9%) cancers.

Expression of CMG2, oestrogen receptor (ER) and androgen receptor (AR) was determined in breast and prostate cancer cell lines, respectively, using real-time quantitative PCR (QPCR) and western blot. Association between CMG2 and sex hormone receptors was analysed in a number of transcriptome datasets. Immunochemical staining was performed in tissue microarrays of breast cancer (BR1505D) and prostate cancer (PR8011A). CMG2 expression was determined in 17&#946;-oestradiol treated breast cancer cells and AR over-expressing prostate cancer cells. CMG2 was found to be inversely correlated with sex hormone receptors in breast and prostate cancer. Lower expression of CMG2 was associated with a poor prognosis in ER (+) breast cancer but not ER (-) tumours. Both ER (+) breast cancer cell lines and AR (+) prostate cancer cell lines presented lower expression of CMG2, which was increased following sex hormone deprivation. Exposure to 17-&#946;-oestradiol and AR over-expression repressed CMG2 expression in breast cancer and prostate cancer cell lines, respectively. CMG2 is inversely correlated with ER and AR status in breast and prostate cancer, respectively. ER and AR mediate repression of CMG2 expression in corresponding cancerous cells.","query":"cancer"},"36316044":{"ArticleTitle":"Identification of a Novel Long Non-coding RNA, lnc-ATMIN-4:2, and its Clinicopathological and Prognostic Significance in Advanced Gastric Cancer.","AbstractText":"Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are emerging as significant regulators of gene expression and a novel promising biomarker for cancer diagnosis and prognosis.

Accumulation of HIF&#945; by loss of functional pVHL promotes tumorigenesis, thus, VHL has tumor suppressor gene capability in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). VHL is the most frequently mutated gene in ccRCC. The complete loss of VHL is mainly achieved by loss of chromosome 3p, which has a VHL coding region in combination with mutation or hypermethylation of the remaining copy of VHL. Given the risk of constitutional chromosome 3 translocation for RCC, it is important to detect the translocation and understand the mechanism underlying the development of multifocal ccRCC. A 67-year-old female patient diagnosed with multifocal RCC underwent robot-assisted partial nephrectomy (RAPN) for three kidney tumors. A cancer gene panel test using next generation sequencing (NGS) detected differential VHL mutations (c.533T>G; p.L178R, c.465_466insTA; p.T157Ifs*3, c.343C>A; p.H115N), while VHL mutation was not detected in peripheral blood DNA. A tendency toward copy number loss of genes on der(3) was also detected in all tumors, but not in the germline one. A karyotype analysis revealed a germline translocation between 3 and 6, t(3;6)(q12;q14).

TMED9 has been implicated in various cancer types; however, its role in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is unclear. In this study, we aimed to elucidate the role and clinical significance of TMED9 in EOC. mRNA and protein levels of TMED9 and their associations with clinicopathological features in EOCs were evaluated using RNA-sequencing and immunohistochemistry data. Functional studies assessing the tumorigenic role of TMED9 in EOC cell lines were also performed. The mRNA expression of TMED9 was up-regulated in EOC compared to that in normal ovarian epithelium. TMED9 protein expression increased in progression from normal ovarian epithelium to EOC (p<0.001). Moreover, high expression of TMED9 was associated with advanced stage, serous cell type and poor histological grade in EOC and demonstrated independent prognostic significance for both disease-free and overall survival. Further functional studies showed that TMED9 knockdown reduced migration, invasion, cell proliferation, and colony formation of EOC cells. Overall, our results support the use of TMED9 as a valuable prognostic biomarker and provide evidence for targeting of TMED9 as a novel strategy for EOC treatment.","query":"cancer"},"36316041":{"ArticleTitle":"Mesonephric-like Carcinosarcoma of the Uterine Corpus: Clinicopathological, Molecular and Prognostic Characteristics in Comparison With Uterine Mesonephric-like Adenocarcinoma and Conventional Endometrial Carcinosarcoma.","AbstractText":"This study aimed to investigate the clinicopathological, prognostic and molecular characteristics of uterine mesonephric-like carcinosarcoma (MLCS).

The epithelial component was exclusively MLA in all MLCS cases. Metastatic and recurrent tumors consisted predominantly or exclusively of MLA in the majority of MLCS cases. Patients with MLCS and MLA presented with more advanced-stage disease than those with CECS. They also exhibited post-treatment recurrence and lung metastases more frequently than CECS. Disease-free survival rates of MLCS and MLA were shorter than those of CECS. Tumor protein 53 gene mutations were detected in four MLCS cases.

Here, we present a 16-month-old boy, with a brain tumor in the third ventricle. The patient underwent complete resection but relapsed two years after diagnosis and underwent a second operation. The tumor was initially classified as a low-grade glioma (WHO grade 2); however, methylation profiling suggested the newly WHO-recognized type: infant-type hemispheric glioma. To further refine the molecular background, and search for druggable targets, whole genome (WGS) and whole transcriptome (RNA-Seq) sequencing was performed. Concomitant WGS and RNA-Seq analysis revealed several segmental gains and losses resulting in complex structural rearrangements and fusion genes. Among the top-candidates was a novel TPR::ROS1 fusion, for which only the 3' end of ROS1 was expressed in tumor tissue, indicating that wild type ROS1 is not normally expressed in the tissue of origin. Functional analysis by Western blot on protein lysates from transiently transfected HEK293 cells showed the TPR::ROS1 fusion gene to activate the MAPK-, PI3K- and JAK\/STAT- pathways through increased phosphorylation of ERK, AKT, STAT and S6. The downstream pathway activation was also confirmed by immunohistochemistry on tumor tissue slides from the patient. We have mapped the activated oncogenic pathways of a novel ROS1-fusion gene and broadened the knowledge of the newly recognized infant-type glioma subtype. The finding facilitates suitable targeted therapies for the patient in case of relapse.","query":"cancer"},"36316039":{"ArticleTitle":"Oral Installation of Recombinant Methioninase-producing Escherichia coli into the Microbiome Inhibits Colon-cancer Growth in a Syngeneic Mouse Model.","AbstractText":"All cancer types so far tested are methionine-addicted.

KISS1, retains maximum physiological activity when it binds to its receptor (KISS1R), allowing KISS1 to effectively function as a suppressor of metastasis in melanomas and other types of cancer. The goal of this study was to evaluate the expression of KISS1 and KISS1R in breast carcinomas from African American (AA) women and correlate their association with clinicopathological features, including breast cancer subtypes, and outcomes. Tissue microarrays were constructed from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded surgical blocks from 216 AA patients. KISS1 and KISS1R expression was assessed using immunohistochemistry. Univariate analysis was used to determine the association between the expression of KISS1 and KISS1R, and clinicopathological characteristics. Pearson correlation was also determined between immunohistochemical H-scores, tumor size, and the number of positive lymph nodes. Kaplan-Meier estimates of overall and disease-free survival were plotted, and log-rank tests were performed to compare estimates among groups. KISS1 protein expression was found to be higher in receptor-negative and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) compared to other subtypes (p<0.001). However, KISS1R expression was higher in non-TNBC tumors compared to other subtypes (p<0.001). Higher KISS1R expression was marginally negatively correlated with tumor size (p=0.077), and positively correlated with lymph-node positivity (p=0.056), and disease-free survival (p=0.092).

Such genes may encode chimeric proteins when two protein-coding regions fuse in-frame, or they may result in deregulation of genes via promoter swapping or translocation of the gene into the vicinity of a highly active regulatory element. A less studied consequence of chromosomal translocations is the fusion of two breakpoint genes resulting in an out-of-frame chimera. The breaks then occur in one or both protein-coding regions forming a stop codon in the chimeric transcript shortly after the fusion point. Though the latter genetic events and mechanisms at first awoke little research interest, careful investigations have established them as neither rare nor inconsequential. In the present work, we review and discuss the truncation of genes in neoplastic cells resulting from chromosomal rearrangements, especially from seemingly balanced translocations.","query":"cancer"},"36316027":{"ArticleTitle":"Overdiagnosis and overuse of diagnostic and screening tests in low-income and middle-income countries: a scoping review.","AbstractText":"Overdiagnosis and overuse of healthcare services harm individuals, take resources that could be used to address underuse, and threaten the sustainability of health systems.

To overcome PD-1\/PD-L1 inhibition in DCs, we developed a novel adeno-associated virus (meAAV) neoantigen vaccine, modified with TLR9 inhibitory fragments, PD-1 trap, and PD-L1 miRNA, which extend the persistence of meAAV and activate neoantigen-specific T-cell responses in immune-competent colorectal and breast cancer murine models. Moreover, we found that in combination with radiotherapy, the meAAV-based neoantigen cancer vaccine not only elicited higher antigen presentation ability, but also maintained neoantigen-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses. These functional PD-1 traps and PD-L1 miRNAs overcome host PD1\/PD-L1 inhibitory mechanisms and boost the therapeutic efficacy of radiotherapy. More importantly, combined radiotherapy and meAAV neoantigen cancer vaccines significantly enhanced neoantigen-specific CTL responses, increased CTL infiltration in tumor microenvironment, and decreased tumor-associated immunosuppression. This process led to the complete elimination of colorectal cancer and delayed tumor growth of breast cancer in tumor-bearing mice.

Willingness-to-pay (WTP) thresholds of $150,000 US dollars (USD) or Canadian dollars (CAD)\/QALY were used. In probabilistic analyses (10,000 simulations), each strategy was incrementally more effective than the previous strategy, but also more costly. Adding polatuzumab-R-CHP to the SOC had an ICER of $546,956 (338,797-1,199,923) USD\/QALY and $245,381 (151,671-573,250) CAD\/QALY.

We hypothesized that primary PCL is not a separate clinical entity, but rather that it represents ultra-high-risk multiple myeloma (MM) characterized by elevated CTC levels. We assessed the levels of CTCs by multiparameter flow cytometry in 395 patients with newly diagnosed transplant-ineligible MM to establish a cutoff for CTCs that identifies the patients with ultra-high-risk PCL-like MM. We tested the cutoff on 185 transplant-eligible patients with MM and further validated on an independent cohort of 280 transplant-ineligible patients treated in the GEM-CLARIDEX trial. The largest published real-world cohort of patients with primary PCL was used for comparison of survival. Finally, we challenged the current 5% threshold for primary PCL diagnosis. Newly diagnosed transplant-ineligible patients with MM with 2%-20% CTCs had significantly shorter progression-free survival (3.1 v 15.6 months; P < .001) and overall survival (14.6 v 33.6 months; P = .023) than patients with < 2%. The 2% cutoff proved to be applicable also in transplant-eligible patients with MM and was successfully validated on an independent cohort of patients from the GEM-CLARIDEX trial. Most importantly, patients with 2%-20% CTCs had comparable dismal outcomes with primary PCL. Moreover, after revealing a low mean difference between flow cytometric and morphologic evaluation of CTCs, we showed that patients with 2%-5% CTCs have similar outcomes as those with 5%-20% CTCs. Our study uncovers that &#8805; 2% CTCs is a biomarker of hidden primary PCL and supports the assessment of CTCs by flow cytometry during the diagnostic workup of MM.","query":"cancer"},"36315919":{"ArticleTitle":"Rare Germline ATM Variants Influence the Development of Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia.","AbstractText":"Germline missense variants of unknown significance in cancer-related genes are increasingly being identified with the expanding use of next-generation sequencing.

We aimed to determine if rare germline ATM variants are more frequent in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) compared with other hematologic malignancies and if they influence the clinical characteristics of CLL. We identified 3,128 patients (including 825 patients with CLL) in our hematologic malignancy clinic who had received clinical-grade sequencing of the entire coding region of ATM. We ascertained the comparative frequencies of germline ATM variants in categories of hematologic neoplasms, and, in patients with CLL, we determined whether these variants affected CLL-associated characteristics such as somatic 11q deletion. Rare germline ATM variants are present in 24% of patients with CLL, significantly greater than that in patients with other lymphoid malignancies (16% prevalence), myeloid disease (15%), or no hematologic neoplasm (14%). Patients with CLL with germline ATM variants are younger at diagnosis and twice as likely to have 11q deletion. The ATM variant p.L2307F is present in 3% of patients with CLL, is associated with a three-fold increase in rates of somatic 11q deletion, and is a hypomorph in cell-based assays. Germline ATM variants cluster within CLL and affect the phenotype of CLL that develops, implying that some of these variants (such as ATM p.L2307F) have functional significance and should not be ignored. Further studies are needed to determine whether these variants affect the response to therapy or account for some of the inherited risk of CLL.","query":"cancer"},"36315917":{"ArticleTitle":"Pertuzumab Plus Trastuzumab in Patients With Colorectal Cancer With ERBB2 Amplification or ERBB2\/3 Mutations: Results From the TAPUR Study.","AbstractText":"The TAPUR Study is a pragmatic phase II basket trial evaluating antitumor activity of commercially available targeted agents in patients with advanced cancers harboring potentially actionable genomic alterations.

Analysis of next-generation sequencing results from 552 patients is included in two prospective precision medicine studies at Gustave Roussy. End points included objective response rates, progression-free survival, and overall survival according to ESCAT.

The most common tumor types were GI (n = 164; 30%), lung (n = 137; 25%), and urologic tumors (n = 68; 13%). Overall, 379 GAs were considered as actionable targets according to ESCAT in 348 (67%) patients. In 31 (6%) patients, two concomitant actionable targets were identified. On the basis of ESCAT, GAs were considered to be classified as tier I in 120 patients (29%), II in 25 patients (5%), III in 80 patients (16%), and IV in 153 patients (30%). A total of 136 patients (27%) received a matched therapy. ESCAT was significantly associated with objective response rates and clinical benefit rates.

However, many patients do not receive the most effective personalized treatments because of challenges associated with integrating predictive biomarker testing into clinical care. Patients are lost at various steps along the precision oncology pathway because of operational inefficiencies, limited understanding of biomarker strategies, inappropriate testing result usage, and access barriers. We examine the impact of various clinical practice gaps associated with diagnostic testing-informed personalized medicine strategies on the treatment of advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (aNSCLC). Using Diaceutics' Data Repository, a multisource database including commercial and Medicare claims and laboratory data from over 500,000 patients with non-small-cell lung cancer in the United States, we analyzed the number of patients with newly diagnosed aNSCLC who could have, but did not, benefit from a personalized treatment. The analysis focuses on the independent and cumulative impacts of gaps occurring during seven steps of the precision oncology pathway, from diagnosis to treatment. For every 1,000 patients in the study cohort, 497 (49.7%) are lost to precision oncology because of factors associated with getting biomarker test results. Among the 503 of 1,000 patients who did receive results from a biomarker test, 147 (29.2%) did not receive appropriate targeted treatments. Thus, approximately 64% of potentially eligible patients with aNSCLC are not benefiting from precision oncology therapies appropriate for their disease. Most patients with aNSCLC eligible for precision oncology treatments do not benefit from them because of clinical practice gaps. This finding is likely reflective of similar gaps in other cancer types. An increased understanding of the impact of each practice gap can inform strategies to improve the delivery of precision oncology, helping to fully realize the promise of personalized medicine.","query":"cancer"},"36315913":{"ArticleTitle":"Lorlatinib for the Treatment of ALK Fusion-Positive Infant-Type Hemispheric Glioma: A Case Report.","AbstractText":"","query":"cancer"},"36315912":{"ArticleTitle":"Noncanonical &#946;-catenin interactions promote leukemia-initiating activity in early T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia.","AbstractText":"T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is a T-cell malignancy, characterized by cell subsets, enriched with leukemia-initiating cells (LIC). &#946;-Catenin modulates LIC activity in T-ALL.

In the present study, we aimed to establish a potential relationship between JAK\/STAT3 signaling activation and clinicopathologic features in ALK- ALCLs, and further recognize the heterogenous nature of these neoplasms. Immunohistochemistry staining of the phosphorylated-STAT3 (p-STAT3) and dual-specificity protein phosphatase 22 (DUSP22) gene rearrangement analysis were performed.

GBM is associated with an abnormal mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway, consisting of two distinct kinase complexes: mTORC1 and mTORC2. The complexes play critical roles in cell proliferation, survival, migration, metabolism, and DNA damage response. This study investigated the aberrant mTORC2 signaling pathway in GBM cells by performing quantitative phosphoproteomic analysis of U87MG cells under different drug treatment conditions. Interestingly, a functional analysis of phosphoproteome revealed that mTORC2 inhibition might be involved in double-strand break (DSB) repair. We further characterized the relationship between mTORC2 and BRISC and BRCA1-A complex member 1 (BABAM1). We demonstrated that pBABAM1 at Ser29 is regulated by mTORC2 to initiate DNA damage response, contributing to DNA repair and cancer cell survival. Accordingly, the inactivation of mTORC2 significantly ablated pBABAM1 (Ser29), reduced DNA repair activities in the nucleus, and promoted apoptosis of the cancer cells. Furthermore, we also recognized that histone H2AX phosphorylation at Ser139 (&#947;H2AX) could be controlled by mTORC2 to repair the DNA. These results provided a better understanding of the mTORC2 function in oncogenic DNA damage response and might lead to specific mTORC2 treatments for brain cancer patients in the future.","query":"cancer"},"36315645":{"ArticleTitle":"Mnk1\/2 kinases regulate memory and autism-related behaviours via Syngap1.","AbstractText":"MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) interacting protein kinases 1 and 2 (Mnk1\/2) regulate a plethora of functions, presumably via phosphorylation of their best characterised substrate, eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) on Ser209.

However, the consequences of these different mechanisms for the regulation of protein expression remain incompletely understood. Here, we performed systematic measurements on the uORF-containing 5' UTR of the cytomegaloviral UL4 mRNA to test alternative models of uORF-mediated regulation in human cells. We find that a terminal diproline-dependent elongating ribosome stall in the UL4 uORF prevents decreases in main ORF protein expression when ribosome loading onto the mRNA is reduced. This uORF-mediated buffering is insensitive to the location of the ribosome stall along the uORF. Computational kinetic modeling based on our measurements suggests that scanning ribosomes dissociate rather than queue when they collide with stalled elongating ribosomes within the UL4 uORF. We identify several human uORFs that repress main ORF protein expression via a similar terminal diproline motif. We propose that ribosome stalls in uORFs provide a general mechanism for buffering against reductions in main ORF translation during stress and developmental transitions.","query":"cancer"},"36315583":{"ArticleTitle":"Reactivity Modulation of Reactive OFF-ON Type G-Quadruplex Alkylating Agents.","AbstractText":"Alkylating agents for nucleic acids have been widely used in cancer chemotherapy, as well as in chemical biology for strong inhibitors and tagging methods.

Around 5 million new cases of skin cancer are recorded in the United States annually. Early identification and evaluation of skin lesions are of great clinical significance, but the disproportionate dermatologist-patient ratio poses a significant problem in most developing nations. Therefore a novel deep architecture, named as SkiNet, is proposed to provide faster screening solution and assistance to newly trained physicians in the process of clinical diagnosis of skin cancer. The main motive behind SkiNet's design and development is to provide a white box solution, addressing a critical problem of trust and interpretability which is crucial for the wider adoption of Computer-aided diagnosis systems by medical practitioners. The proposed SkiNet is a two-stage pipeline wherein the lesion segmentation is followed by the lesion classification. Monte Carlo dropout and test time augmentation techniques have been employed in the proposed method to estimate epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty. A novel segmentation model named Bayesian MultiResUNet is used to estimate the uncertainty on the predicted segmentation map. Saliency-based methods like XRAI, Grad-CAM and Guided Backprop are explored to provide post-hoc explanations of the deep learning models. The ISIC-2018 dataset is used to perform the experimentation and ablation studies. The results establish the robustness of the proposed model on the traditional benchmarks while addressing the black-box nature of such models to alleviate the skepticism of medical practitioners by incorporating transparency and confidence to the model's prediction.","query":"cancer"},"36315465":{"ArticleTitle":"Uniportal Robotic-Assisted Thoracoscopic Surgery for early-stage lung cancer with the Da Vinci Xi: Initial experience of two cases.","AbstractText":"Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) techniques, currently considered the gold standard in the treatment of early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), are mainly represented by video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS), both uniportal and multiportal, and by robotic-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (RATS). While multiportal RATS has been accepted as a valid alternative to VATS, carrying the advantages of three-dimensional high-definition visualization and improved maneuverability, very few reports exist in literature on the application of uniportal RATS (U-RATS). Therefore, we describe our initial experience with this recently developed method in the treatment of early-stage NSCLC. U-RATS was conducted through a single 4 cm long antero-lateral mini-thoracotomy (AMLT) in the 6th intercostal space at the mid-axillary line. Three 8 mm robotic trocars were positioned and connected, from back to front, to robotic arms as follows: 30&#176; camera arm, robotic arm 2 (bipolar fenestrated grasper) and 1 (Maryland bipolar forceps). Assistant access was identified as the most anterior part of AMLT. Case 1: an 82-year-old woman (ASA III) underwent a left S6 segmentectomy for a clinical stage IA2 NSCLC, complicated by an air leak that resolved spontaneously by PO Day 3. Case 2: a 75-year-old man (ASA III) underwent an uncomplicated right lower lobectomy for a clinical stage IA3 NSCLC. Case 1 and 2 were discharged on PO Day 5 and 4, respectively. From what emerged in our small series, U-RATS with the Da Vinci Xi surgical system might be considered a safe, reliable, and effective alternative to other MIS techniques. Larger prospective studies are required to validate these findings. This article is protected by copyright.

At the primary tumor site, tumor cells could take on mesenchymal properties, termed the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). This process is partly regulated by members of the cadherin (CDH) family of genes, and it is an essential step in the formation of metastases. There has been a lot of study of the roles of some of the CDH family genes in cancer; however, a holistic approach examining the roles of distinct CDH family genes in the development of breast cancer remains largely unexplored. In the present study, we used a bioinformatics approach to examine expression profiles of CDH family genes using the Oncomine, Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis 2 (GEPIA2), cBioPortal, MetaCore, and Tumor IMmune Estimation Resource (TIMER) platforms. We revealed that CDH1\/2\/4\/11\/12\/13 messenger (m)RNA levels are overexpressed in breast cancer cells compared to normal cells and were correlated with poor prognoses in breast cancer patients' distant metastasis-free survival. An enrichment analysis showed that high expressions of CDH1\/2\/4\/11\/12\/13 were significantly correlated with cell adhesion, the extracellular matrix remodeling process, the EMT, WNT\/beta-catenin, and interleukin-mediated immune responses. Collectively, CDH1\/2\/4\/11\/12\/13 are thought to be potential biomarkers for breast cancer progression and metastasis.","query":"cancer"},"36315425":{"ArticleTitle":"Revised International Staging System (R-ISS) stage-dependent analysis uncovers oncogenes and potential immunotherapeutic targets in multiple myeloma.","AbstractText":"Multiple myeloma (MM) accounts for ~10% of all haematologic malignancies. Little is known about high intratumour heterogeneities in patients stratified by the Revised International Staging System (R-ISS). Herein, we constructed a single-cell transcriptome atlas to compare differential expression patterns among stages. We found that a novel cytotoxic plasma cell (PC) population exhibited with NKG7 positive was obviously enriched in stage II patients. Additionally, a malignant plasma cell population with significantly elevated expression of MKI67 and PCNA was associated with unfavourable prognosis and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection in our collected samples. Moreover, Ribonucleotide Reductase Regulatory Subunit M2 (RRM2) was found and verified to promote proliferation of MM cell lines, suggesting RRM2 may serve as a detrimental marker in MM. The percentages of CD8+ T cells and NKT cells decreased along with R-ISS stages, reflecting the plasticity of the tumour immune microenvironment. Importantly, their crosstalks with myeloid cells and PC identified several potential immunotargets such as SIRPA-CD47, and CD74-MIF, respectively. Collectively, this study provided an R-ISS-related single-cell MM atlas and revealed the clinical significance of novel PC clusters, as well as potential immunotargets in MM progression.","query":"cancer"},"36315410":{"ArticleTitle":"Electrochemical Biosensor Based on l-Arginine and rGO-AuNSs Deposited on the Electrode Combined with DNA Probes for Ultrasensitive Detection of the Gastric Cancer-Related PIK3CA Gene of ctDNA.","AbstractText":"Gene biomarkers of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in liquid biopsies have been explored for use in the precise diagnosis of tumors. There is a great clinical need to realize the ultrasensitive detection of gene biomarkers in ctDNA. Here we reported that an ultrasensitive label-free biosensor was developed for the detection of the gastric cancer-related PIK3CA gene of ctDNA in peripheral blood. The polymeric l-arginine and graphene oxide-wrapped gold nanostars (rGO-AuNSs) were prepared and deposited on the glass electrode. The capturing DNA probes for the PIK3CA gene were prepared and successfully immobilized on the rGO-AuNS-modified electrode surface via &#960;-&#960; interaction among the rGO-AuNS composites and DNA probes. The resultant electrochemical sensor was effectively applied to detect the PIK3CA gene of ctDNA via the hybridization between the capturing DNA probe and ctDNA, the result of which showed that the biosensor exhibited desirable sensitivity, stability, and a wider dynamic response in a ctDNA concentration range from 1.0 &#215; 10-20 to 1.0 &#215; 10-10 M (R2 = 0.997). Moreover, the low limit of detection of 1.0 &#215; 10-20 M (S\/N = 3) indicates the biosensor owns satisfactory detection sensitivity. Fourteen PIK3CA genes and two PIK3CA gene mutations were detected in 60 clinical ctDNA samples of gastric cancer patients by using the developed biosensor. In conclusion, this ultrasensitive label-free electrochemical biosensor possesses a significant application prospect in the detection of the PIK3CA gene in ctDNA and in early screening for gastric cancer in the near future.","query":"cancer"},"36315404":{"ArticleTitle":"Development of Drug Carriers with Biocompatibility Based On Human Serum Albumin and &#946;-Cyclodextrin Molecules and Study of Anticancer Activity.","AbstractText":"Herein, a novel molecule S4, which could form a uniform S4 spherical aggregate in water, was synthesized, and the S4 aggregate was used to load Dox to prepare the S4@Dox nanomedicine.

By binding irreversibly to KRASG12C, sotorasib inhibits downstream signalling pathways which are associated with cell growth and differentiation. Sotorasib is indicated for the treatment of adults with advanced, previously treated, KRAS G12C mutation-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in multiple countries, including the countries of the EU and the USA. A clinically relevant objective response rate was observed in patients with KRAS G12C mutation-positive NSCLC during the primary analysis and in an updated analysis of the phase I\/II CodeBreaK 100 trial. Furthermore, a clinically relevant response duration was reported in updated analyses of the trial. Sotorasib has a manageable tolerability profile, with permitted dose modifications to manage toxicity. In summary, sotorasib is a promising KRASG12C inhibitor that increases the available treatment options for patients with KRAS G12C mutation-positive NSCLC who were previously treated with platinum-based chemotherapy and\/or immunotherapy. KRAS is a protein that is involved in cell signalling pathways, including those that are associated with cell growth and differentiation. KRAS mutations are detected in 23% of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), with the G12C mutation being the most common. G12C-mutant KRAS (KRASG12C) is kept in an activated state, which is associated with cancer. Sotorasib (LUMAKRAS&#8482; in the USA and LUMYKRAS&#8482; in the EU), which is taken orally once daily, is the first approved drug that inhibits KRASG12C; it permanently binds to KRASG12C and locks it in an inactivated state. Sotorasib is approved for adults who have advanced, previously treated, KRAS G12C mutation-positive NSCLC. In a clinical trial in patients with KRAS G12C mutation-positive NSCLC, a clinically relevant proportion of patients responded to sotorasib treatment. Furthermore, the duration of effectiveness with sotorasib was considered to be clinically relevant. Adverse reactions with sotorasib treatment were manageable; the dose may be decreased and\/or sotorasib treatment may be temporarily stopped to manage adverse reactions.

Mapping the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) using paired-agent imaging (PAI) has the potential to provide more consistent intraoperative margin assessment in a fraction of the time as FFS. PAI was carried out through IV injection of an anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) affibody molecule (ABY-029, eIND 122,681) and an untargeted IRDye680LT carboxylate. Imaging was performed on 4 &#181;m frozen sections from three oral squamous cell carcinoma xenograft mouse models (n&#8201;=&#8201;24, 8 samples per cell line). The diagnostic ability and tumor contrast were compared between binding potential, targeted, and untargeted images. Confidence maps were constructed based on group histogram-derived tumor probability curves. Tumor differentiability and contrast by confidence maps were evaluated. PAI outperformed ABY-029 and IRDye 680LT alone, demonstrating the highest individual receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve area under the curve (PAI AUC: 0.91, 0.90, and 0.79) and contrast-to-noise ratio (PAI CNR: 1, 1.1, and 0.6) for FaDu, Det 562, and A253. PAI confidence maps (PAI CM) maintain high tumor diagnostic ability (PAI CMAUC: 0.91, 0.90, and 0.79) while significantly enhancing tumor contrast (PAI CMCNR: 1.5, 1.3, and 0.8) in FaDu, Det 562, and A253. Additionally, the PAI confidence map allows avascular A253 to be differentiated from a healthy tissue with significantly higher contrast than PAI. Notably, PAI does not require additional staining and therefore significantly reduces the tumor delineation time in a 5 [Formula: see text] 5&#160;mm slice from&#8201;~&#8201;35&#160;min to under a minute. This study demonstrated that PAI improved tumor detection in frozen sections with high diagnostic accuracy and rapid analysis times. The novel PAI confidence map improved the contrast in vascular tumors and differentiability in avascular tumors. With a larger database, the PAI confidence map promises to standardize fluorescence imaging in intraoperative pathology-assisted surgery (IPAS).","query":"cancer"},"36315363":{"ArticleTitle":"Step-by-step approach with anatomical highlights in SMV-first laparoscopic right colectomy.","AbstractText":"","query":"cancer"},"36315362":{"ArticleTitle":"A Hybrid Discrete-Continuum Modelling Approach to Explore the Impact of T-Cell Infiltration on Anti-tumour Immune Response.","AbstractText":"We present a spatial hybrid discrete-continuum modelling framework for the interaction dynamics between tumour cells and cytotoxic T cells, which play a pivotal role in the immune response against tumours. In this framework, tumour cells and T cells are modelled as individual agents while chemokines that drive the chemotactic movement of T cells towards the tumour are modelled as a continuum. We formally derive the continuum counterpart of this model, which is given by a coupled system that comprises an integro-differential equation for the density of tumour cells, a partial differential equation for the density of T cells and a partial differential equation for the concentration of chemokines. We report on computational results of the hybrid model and show that there is an excellent quantitative agreement between them and numerical solutions of the corresponding continuum model. These results shed light on the mechanisms that underlie the emergence of different levels of infiltration of T cells into the tumour and elucidate how T-cell infiltration shapes anti-tumour immune response. Moreover, to present a proof of concept for the idea that, exploiting the computational efficiency of the continuum model, extensive numerical simulations could be carried out, we investigate the impact of T-cell infiltration on the response of tumour cells to different types of anti-cancer immunotherapy.","query":"cancer"},"36315356":{"ArticleTitle":"Wide-field radiation therapy for skin cancerisation - Have we forgotten what we learned?","AbstractText":"","query":"cancer"},"36315351":{"ArticleTitle":"A narrative review on the non-surgical treatment of chronic postoperative inguinal pain: a challenge for both surgeon and anaesthesiologist.","AbstractText":"Chronic pain is one of the most frequent clinical problems after inguinal hernia surgery.

With new clinical data available, this study aims to assess the comparative cost-effectiveness of DOACs and LMWHs over 6- and 60-month treatment durations from the US healthcare system and societal perspectives. A Markov model for cancer patients eligible to receive rivaroxaban, edoxaban, apixaban, enoxaparin, or dalteparin was used to conduct a cost-utility analysis. Clinical scenarios were analyzed based on 6- and 60-month time horizons from the US healthcare system and societal perspectives. The main outcome was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), expressed as cost in US dollars per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to evaluate the robustness of the results. DOACs were cost-saving and clinically superior to LMWHs and were associated with a cost change ranging from -&#160;$9134.66 to -&#160;$15,281.92 and incremental effectiveness of 0.43-1.25 QALYs among four clinical scenarios. The most influential model inputs for ICER were the utility associated with LMWH use and probabilities of non-VTE and non-bleeding related death. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses were consistent with the results. DOACs were found to dominate LMWHs, suggesting that DOACs may be a cost-effective alternative to LMWHs for CAT. This study can help inform decision-makers on the cost-effectiveness of anticoagulation strategies and help in the development of future practice recommendations for cancer patients.","query":"cancer"},"36315334":{"ArticleTitle":"Roles of oncogenes in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and their therapeutic potentials.","AbstractText":"Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is the most common type of esophageal cancer (EC) in Asia.

The pooled sensitivity and specificity of ctDNA for minimal residual disease (MRD) detection were 0.58 and 0.93, respectively. The pooled positive and negative likelihood ratios were 7.57 (95% confidence interval (CI) 2.84-20.20) and 0.45 (95% CI 0.37-0.55), respectively. The area under the summary receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.8967, and the diagnostic odds ratio was 32.26 (95% CI 14.63-71.12). In addition, both precurative-treatment and postcurative-treatment ctDNA positivity was associated with worse recurrence-free survival (hazard ratio (HR), 3.82 and 8.32, respectively) and worse overall survival (HR, 3.82 and 4.73, respectively). The findings suggested that ctDNA detection has beneficial utility regarding MRD detection specificity; moreover, positive ctDNA was associated with poor prognosis in patients with localized NSCLC.","query":"cancer"},"36315307":{"ArticleTitle":"Routine and interval detection of locoregional breast cancer recurrences and risk of subsequent distant metastasis.","AbstractText":"Follow-up for breast cancer survivors consists of after care and surveillance. The benefits of routine surveillance visits remain debatable. In this study we compared the severity of locoregional recurrences (LRRs) and the subsequent risk of a distant metastasis (DM) between LRRs detected at routine and interval visits. Women diagnosed with early breast cancer between 2003 and 2008 in one of the 15 participating hospitals, and who developed a LRR as first event after primary treatment, were selected from the Netherlands Cancer Registry (Cohort A). Chi-squared tests were used to compare the severity of routine- and interval-detected local recurrences (LRs) and regional recurrences (RRs), using tumor size, tumor grade, and number of positive lymph nodes. Data on the development of a subsequent DM after a LRR were available for a subset of patients (Cohort B). Cohort B was used to estimate the association between way of LRR-detection and risk of a DM. Cohort A consisted of 109 routine- and 113 interval-LRR patients. The severity of routine-detected LRs or RRs and interval-detected LRs or RRs did not significantly differ. Cohort B consisted of 66 routine- and 61 interval-LRR patients. Sixteen routine- (24%) and 17 (28%) interval-LRR patients developed a DM. After adjustment, way of LRR-detection was not significantly associated with the risk of a DM (hazard ratio: 1.22; 95% confidence interval: 0.49-3.06). The current study showed that routine visits did not lead to less severe LRRs and did not decrease the risk of a subsequent DM.","query":"cancer"},"36315303":{"ArticleTitle":"PIM3 kinase promotes tumor metastasis in hepatoblastoma by upregulating cell surface expression of chemokine receptor cxcr4.","AbstractText":"Patients presenting with metastatic hepatoblastoma have limited treatment options and survival rates as low as 25%. We previously demonstrated that Proviral Integration site in Maloney murine leukemia virus 3 (PIM3) kinase promotes tumorigenesis and cancer cell stemness in hepatoblastoma. In this study, we assessed the role of PIM3 kinase in promoting hepatoblastoma metastasis. We utilized a tail vein injection model of metastasis to evaluate the effect of CRISPR\/Cas9-mediated PIM3 knockout, stable overexpression of PIM3, and pharmacologic PIM inhibition on the formation of lung metastasis. In vivo studies revealed PIM3 knockout impaired the formation of lung metastasis: 5 out of 6 mice injected with wild type hepatoblastoma cells developed lung metastasis while none of the 7 mice injected with PIM3 knockout hepatoblastoma cells developed lung metastasis. PIM3 overexpression in hepatoblastoma increased the pulmonary metastatic burden in mice and mechanistically, upregulated the phosphorylation and cell surface expression of CXCR4, a key receptor in the progression of cancer cell metastasis. CXCR4 blockade with AMD3100 decreased the metastatic phenotype of PIM3 overexpressing cells, indicating that CXCR4 contributed to PIM3's promotion of hepatoblastoma metastasis. Clinically, PIM3 expression correlated positively with CXCR4 expression in primary hepatoblastoma tissues. In conclusion, we have shown PIM3 kinase promotes the metastatic phenotype of hepatoblastoma cells through upregulation of CXCR4 cell surface expression and these findings suggest that targeting PIM3 kinase may provide a novel therapeutic strategy for metastatic hepatoblastoma.","query":"cancer"},"36315286":{"ArticleTitle":"Fall risk related to subtype-specific alpha-antagonists for benign prostatic hyperplasia: a nationwide Korean population-based cohort study.","AbstractText":"Subtype-specific alpha-antagonists are medications commonly prescribed for lower urinary-tract symptoms, benign prostatic hyperplasia in older populations.

Distinction between these types is accomplished by correlation of clinical, radiologic, and laboratory findings with pathologic features. Primary hyperparathyroidism occurs sporadically in 85% of cases with the remaining cases associated with multiple familial syndromes. The pathologic manifestations of primary hyperparathyroidism include parathyroid adenoma, parathyroid hyperplasia, and parathyroid carcinoma. Recent advances in the understanding of the pathogenesis of parathyroid disease has helped to refine the diagnosis and classification of parathyroid lesions. The identification of multiple clonal proliferations in traditional multiglandular parathyroid hyperplasia has led to the adoption by the World Health Organization (WHO) of the alternate term of primary hyperparathyroidism-related multiglandular parathyroid disease. Additional nomenclature changes include the adoption of the term atypical parathyroid tumor in lieu of atypical parathyroid adenoma to reflect the uncertain malignant potential of these neoplasms. Clinical and morphologic features characteristic of familial disease have been described that can help the practicing pathologist identify underlying familial disease and provide appropriate management. Use of ancillary immunohistochemistry and molecular studies can be helpful in classifying parathyroid neoplasms. Parafibromin has proven useful as a diagnostic and prognostic marker in atypical parathyroid tumors and parathyroid carcinomas. This review provides an update on the diagnosis and classification of parathyroid lesions considering the recent advances in the understanding of the molecular and clinical features of parathyroid disease and highlights the use of ancillary studies (immunohistochemical, and molecular) to refine the diagnosis of parathyroid lesions.","query":"cancer"},"36315268":{"ArticleTitle":"Lymphodepleting chemotherapy practices and effect on safety and efficacy outcomes in patients with solid tumours undergoing T cell receptor-engineered T cell (TCR-T) Therapy: a systematic review and meta-analysis.","AbstractText":"T cell receptor-engineered T cell (TCR-T) therapy has shown promising efficacy in advanced solid tumours.

Hub IRGs were further identified by real time PCR. The single-sample gene set enrichment analysis algorithm and Pearson correlation analysis were used to define immune cell infiltration and the relationships between hub IRGs and immune cells. Cell viability and migration were evaluated by CCK-8 and Transwell assays. A xenograft mouse model was used to verify the relationship between Src homology 3 (SH3) domain GRB2-like 2 (SH3GL2) expression and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). Eight upregulated genes and six downregulated IRGs were identified in invasive RB. Seven IRGs were confirmed by real-time PCR. Moreover, the proportions of MDSCs were higher in invasive RB tissues than in noninvasive RB tissues. Furthermore, correlation analysis of altered immune genes and cells suggested that SH3GL2, Langerhans cell protein 1 (LCP1) and transmembrane immune signaling adaptor TYROBP have strong connections with MDSCs. Specifically, decreased SH3GL2 expression promoted the migration of RB cells in vitro, increased the tumor size and weight, and increased the numbers of MDSCs in the tumor and spleen in vivo. This study indicated that SH3GL2 and MDSCs play a critical role in RB progression and invasion and provide candidate targets for the treatment of RB.","query":"cancer"},"36315121":{"ArticleTitle":"Parent Perceptions of a Pretend Play Intervention for Their Children With Cancer.","AbstractText":"Although the rate of survival in childhood cancer today is close to 85%, a cancer diagnosis can still turn the world upside down for both children and parents.

Therapeutic pretend play has been suggested as a means to encourage children to express and handle emotions in a safe environment. This study was developed to describe and explore parents' experiences of a pretend play intervention that consisted of six to eight play sessions with a play facilitator administered to their children undergoing cancer treatment. A descriptive qualitative method was used, including individual interviews with 15 parents. Three main categories were developed, including (a) experiences of joining the project, (b) perceptions of the play intervention, and (c) reflections on effects and implications, with subcategories evolved for each category. The parents experienced that the play sessions helped improve their children's communication skills and made them more capable of participating in their care. They appreciated that the intervention focused on the child's well-being and saw it as a positive break in their child's cancer treatment. It also helped them better reflect on their own situation. According to the parents' experiences, pretend play can be a helpful tool for improving children's participation in their cancer care that strengthens their autonomy, emotional repertoire, and communication skills.

There are several factors that can degrade image quality and, correspondingly, there are many approaches to mitigate their negative impact. In this paper, we address image quality control toward our goal of improving the performance of automated visual evaluation (AVE) for cervical precancer screening. Specifically, we report efforts made toward classifying images into four quality categories (\"unusable\", \"unsatisfactory\", \"limited\", and \"evaluable\") and improving the quality classification performance by automatically identifying mislabeled and overly ambiguous images. The proposed new deep learning ensemble framework is an integration of several networks that consists of three main components: cervix detection, mislabel identification, and quality classification. We evaluated our method using a large dataset that comprises 87,420 images obtained from 14,183 patients through several cervical cancer studies conducted by different providers using different imaging devices in different geographic regions worldwide. The proposed ensemble approach achieved higher performance than the baseline approaches.","query":"cancer"},"36315104":{"ArticleTitle":"Dietary Antioxidant-Constructed Nanodrugs Can High-Efficiently Kill Cancer Cells while Protecting Noncancer Cells.","AbstractText":"Despite great advances, the development of cancer drugs that can efficiently kill cancer cells while protecting noncancer cells has not been achieved. By using only dietary antioxidants vitamin C (VC) and (R)-(+)-lipoic acid (LA), we herein develop a nanodrug VC@cLAV featuring the above function. After entering cells, cLAV dissociates into LA and DHLA (dihydrolipoic acid, reduced form of LA) and releases VC and DHA (dehydroascorbate, oxidized form of VC). In cancer cells, the two redox pairs recycle each other and dramatically promote the intracellular reactive oxygen species production to kill cancer cells at low doses comparable to cytotoxic drugs. Oppositely in noncancer cells, the LA\/DHLA and VC\/DHA pairs exert anti-oxidant action to actively protect the organism by preventing the normal cells from oxidative stress and repairing cells suffering from oxidative stress. When compared with the first-line cytotoxic drug, VC@cLAV displayed superior therapeutic outcomes yet without side effects in diverse tumor models including patient-derived xenograft (PDX). This drug with efficient cancer cell killing and noncancer cell protection represents a new cancer therapy.","query":"cancer"},"36315102":{"ArticleTitle":"Lack of efficacy of fenbendazole against Giardia duodenalis in a naturally infected population of dogs in France.","AbstractText":"Giardiosis is a worldwide intestinal parasitosis, affecting both humans and animals. Treatment in dogs remains limited and the lack of efficacy of the few approved medications is a rising concern. In this study, 23 dogs raised by veterinary students and naturally infected with Giardia duodenalis were treated in home conditions with fenbendazole (50&#160;mg\/kg orally for 5 consecutive days). Fecal samples were collected immediately before treatment (FS1), 2-4&#160;days after treatment (FS2) and 8-10&#160;days after treatment (FS3). Giardia duodenalis cyst excretion was measured quantitatively by direct immunofluorescence assay (DFA) at FS1, FS2 and FS3. Molecular typing with a nested PCR targeting the SSU rDNA locus was also performed at FS1 and FS2. Fecal consistency improved in 16\/21 dogs (76%) and mean cyst shedding was reduced by 84% after treatment. However, only 8\/23 dogs (35%) achieved therapeutic success (&#8805;90% reduction of cysts) and only 4\/23 dogs (17%) had complete elimination of G. duodenalis. Molecular typing showed that dogs harbored only canine-specific assemblages, with a high prevalence of assemblage C in analyzed samples (30\/39). We also detected different assemblages after treatment and nucleotide substitutions in assemblage C sequences that have not been described previously. Eight to ten days after treatment, high Giardia cyst excretion was measured, suggesting possible reinfection despite hygiene measures and\/or multiplication. These data suggest that fenbendazole treatment may improve fecal consistency but has limited therapeutic efficacy against giardiosis in this population of dogs.

Attenuation of RNA Polymerase II (Pol II) is more prevalent than once appreciated, targeting 10-15% of mRNA genes in yeast through higher eukaryotes, but its significance and mechanism remain obscure. In the yeast S. cerevisiae, Pol II attenuation was initially shown to rely on Nrd1-Nab3-Sen1 termination, but more recently our lab characterized a hybrid termination pathway involving Hrp1, an RNA-binding protein in the 3'-end cleavage factor (CF). One of the hybrid attenuation gene targets is DEF1, which encodes a repair protein that promotes degradation of Pol II stalled at DNA lesions. In this study we characterized the chromosomal DEF1 attenuator and the functional role of Hrp1. DEF1 attenuator mutants overexpressed Def1 mRNA and protein, exacerbated Pol II degradation, and hindered cell growth, supporting a biologically significant DEF1 attenuator function. Using an auxin-induced Hrp1 depletion system, we identified new Hrp1-dependent attenuators in MNR2, SNG1, and RAD3 genes. An hrp1-5 mutant (L205S) known to impair binding to CF protein Rna14 also disrupted attenuation, but surprisingly no widespread defect was observed for an hrp1-1 mutant (K160E) located in the RNA recognition motif (RRM). We designed a new RRM mutant (hrp1-F162W) that altered a highly conserved residue and was lethal in single copy. In a heterozygous strain, hrp1-F162W exhibited dominant-negative read through defects at multiple gene attenuators. Overall our results expand the hybrid Pol II termination pathway, confirming that Hrp1-dependent attenuation controls multiple yeast genes and may function through binding CF proteins and\/or RNA.","query":"cancer"},"36315097":{"ArticleTitle":"Somatic Inactivation of Breast Cancer Predisposition Genes in Tumours Associated with Pathogenic Germline Variants.","AbstractText":"Breast cancers (BC) that arise in individuals heterozygous for a germline pathogenic variant in a susceptibility gene, such as BRCA1\/2, PALB2 and RAD51C, have been shown to exhibit bi-allelic loss in the respective genes, and be associated with triple-negative (TN) BC and distinctive somatic mutational signatures. Tumour sequencing thus presents an orthogonal approach to assess the role of candidate genes in BC development. Exome sequencing was performed on paired normal-breast tumour DNA from 124 carriers of germline loss-of-function (LoF) or missense (MS) mutations carriers in 15 known and candidate BC predisposition genes identified in the BEACCON case-control study. Bi-allelic inactivation and association with tumour genome features including mutational signatures and homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) score were investigated. BARD1-carrying TN BC (4\/5) displayed bi-allelic loss and associated high HRD scores and mutational signature 3, as did a RAD51D-carrying TN BC and ovarian cancer. Bi-allelic loss was less frequent in BRIP1 BCs (4\/13) and had low HRD scores. In contrast to other established BC genes, BCs from carriers of CHEK2 LoF (6\/17) or MS (2\/20) carriers had low rates of bi-allelic loss. Exploratory analysis of BC from carriers of LoF mutations in candidate genes such as BLM, FANCM, PARP2 and RAD50 found little evidence of bi-allelic inactivation. BARD1 and RAD51D behave as classic BRCA-like genes with bi-allelic inactivation but this was not observed for any of the candidate genes. However, as demonstrated for CHEK2, the absence of bi-allelic inactivation does not provide definitive evidence against the gene's involvement in BC predisposition.","query":"cancer"},"36315080":{"ArticleTitle":"Speeding Implementation in Cancer: The National Cancer Institute's Implementation Science in Cancer Control Centers.","AbstractText":"The National Cancer Institute's (NCI) Implementation Science in Cancer Control Centers (ISC3) Network represents a large-scale initiative to create an infrastructure to support and enable the efficient, effective, and equitable translation of approaches and evidence-based treatments to reduce cancer risk and improve outcomes.

The amount of erector spinae muscle has been reported to be related to the prognosis of several respiratory diseases. However, few studies clarify the impact on postoperative non-small cell lung cancer. We investigated the relationship between erector spinae muscle and postoperative prognosis in early-stage non-small cell lung cancer. We reviewed the medical records of 534 patients with stage I non-small cell lung cancer who underwent lobectomy or segmentectomy. The erector spinae muscle was identified by preoperative computed tomography, and the amount was normalized according to height and sex. Overall survival, lung cancer-related death, and non-lung cancer-related death were analyzed using log-rank and Gray's tests. Multivariable analyses were conducted to identify factors that influenced overall survival and non-lung cancer-related death. The amount of erector spinae muscle normalized according to height and sex was significantly associated with age and body mass index, and when the amount was low, overall survival (five-year overall survival, 79.6 vs 89.5%; P&#8201;<&#8201;0.001) and non-lung cancer-related death (five-year cumulative mortality rate, 14.7 vs 6.8%; P&#8201;<&#8201;0.001) were significantly worse, although no difference was found in lung cancer-related death. The amount of preoperative erector spinae muscle was strongly related to non-lung cancer-related death and was a significant prognostic factor for stage I non-small cell lung cancer.

Comparative genomics, utilizing Rattus norvegicus strains differing in susceptibility to mammary tumor development, is a complimentary approach to identify breast cancer susceptibility genes. Mammary carcinoma susceptibility 3 (Mcs3) is a Copenhagen (COP\/NHsd) allele that confers resistance to mammary carcinomas when introgressed into a mammary carcinoma susceptible Wistar Furth (WF\/NHsd) genome. Here Mcs3 was positionally mapped to a 7.2&#8201;Mb region of RNO1 spanning rs8149408 to rs107402736 (Chr1:143700228-150929594, build 6.0\/rn6) using WF.COP congenic strains and DMBA-induced mammary carcinogenesis. Male and female WF.COP-Mcs3 rats had significantly lower body mass compared to the WF strain. The effect on female body mass was observed only when females were raised in the absence of males indicating a socioenvironmental interaction. Furthermore, female WF.COP-Mcs3 rats, raised in the absence of males, did not develop enhanced lobuloalveolar morphologies compared to those observed in the WF strain. Human 15q25.1-25.2 was determined to be orthologous to rat Mcs3 (chr15:80005820-82285404 and chr15:83134545-84130720, build GRCh38\/hg38).

However, the CDT is substantially hindered by glutathione (GSH) scavenging effect on &#183;OH, low intracellular H2O2 level, and low reaction rate, resulting in unsatisfactory efficacy. Here, a cancer cell membrane (CM)-camouflaged Au nanorod core\/mesoporous MnO2 shell yolk-shell nanocatalyst embedded with glucose oxidase (GOD) and Dox (denoted as AMGDC) is constructed for synergistic triple-augmented CDT and chemotherapy of tumor under MRI\/PAI guidance. Benefiting from the homologous adhesion and immune escaping property of the cancer CM, the nanocatalysts can target tumor and gradually accumulate in tumor site. For triple-augmented CDT, first, the MnO2 shell reacts with intratumoral GSH to generate Mn2+ and glutathione disulfide, which achieves Fenton-like ion delivery and weakening of GSH-mediated scavenging effect, leading to GSH depletion-enhanced CDT. Second, the intratumoral glucose can be oxidized to H2O2 and gluconic acid by GOD, achieving supplementary H2O2-enhanced CDT. Next, the AuNRs absorbing in NIR-II elevate the local tumor temperature upon NIR-II laser irradiation, achieving photothermal-enhanced CDT. Dox is rapidly released for adjuvant chemotherapy due to responsive degradation of MnO2 shell. Moreover, GSH-activated PAI\/MRI can be used to monitor CDT process.

Trajectory analyses and infection models showed intermediate cells arise from progenitor cells before bifurcating into terminal effector and exhausted subsets. Genetic ablation experiments identified that type I IFN drives exhaustion through an IRF7-dependent mechanism, possibly through an IFN-stimulated subset bridging progenitor and exhausted cells. Conversely, Zeb2 was critical for generating effector cells. Intriguingly, some T cell clones exhibited lineage bias. Mechanistically, we identified that TCR avidity correlates with an exhausted fate, whereas SHP-1 selectively restricts low-avidity effector cell accumulation. Thus, our work elucidates novel mechanisms underlying CD8+ T cell fate determination during persistent infection and suggests two potential pathways leading to exhaustion.","query":"cancer"},"36315046":{"ArticleTitle":"Biological functions of active ingredients in quinoa bran: Advance and prospective.","AbstractText":"Quinoa is known to be a rich source of nutrients and bioactive components.

We analyzed high-throughput TCRb sequencing data generated with ImmunoSEQ platform using peripheral blood and tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) from HNSCC patients before and after cetuximab treatment (pre-\/post-PBMC vs. pre-\/post-TIL). Multiple analytic approaches were employed to normalize sequencing data. Normalized TCR richness was significantly lower in post-TIL than pre-TIL, suggesting that cetuximab reduced TCR diversity and promoted TCR expansion in TIL samples, regardless of response status. The magnitude of clonal expansion (defined as expansion rate) in top-20 TCR clonotypes was significantly higher in responder PBMC with or without normalization, and in responder TIL upon normalization, than non-responder ones. Notably, the expanded top-20 or top-50 TCR clonotypes overlapped between PBMC and TIL samples, which occurred significantly more frequently in responders than non-responders. Cetuximab-treated HNSCC patients harbor dynamic changes of TCR repertoires correlative to therapeutic responses. The expansion rate of top TCR clonotypes in peripheral blood may serve as a minimally invasive, readily accessible, and feasible marker for predicting cetuximab responses in HNSCCs and beyond, and the expansion rate of top TCR clonotypes in TILs and their overlapping probability between PBMC and TIL may serve as additional predictive markers.

Indocyanine green (ICG) can be used as a photosensitizer for photothermal therapy (PTT), in addition to fluorescent dyes for tumor imaging. In this study, a dimeric Her2-specific Affibody (ZHer2) based on ZHer2:2891 was prepared using the E. coli expression system and then coupled to ICG through an N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) ester reactive group to construct a novel bifunctional protein drug (named ICG-ZHer2) for tumor diagnosis and PTT. In vitro, ICG-ZHer2-mediated PTT selectively and efficiently killed Her2-positive BT-474 and SKOV-3 tumor cells rather than Her2-negative HeLa tumor cells. In vivo, ICG-ZHer2 specifically accumulated in Her2-positive SKOV-3 tumor grafts rather than Her2-negative HeLa tumor grafts; high-contrast tumor optical images were obtained. However, Her2-negative HeLa tumor grafts were not detected. More importantly, ICG-ZHer2-mediated PTT exhibited a significantly enhanced antitumor effect in mice bearing SKOV-3 tumor grafts owing to the good photothermal properties of ICG-ZHer2. Of note, ICG-ZHer2 did not exhibit acute toxicity in mice during short-term treatment.

To validate a signal simulation framework for the use of sequence parameter optimization. To demonstrate the feasibility of ME-bSSFP for HP 13 C-MRI in patients. To evaluate the metabolism in PCa measured by ME-bSSFP. Retrospective single-center cohort study. Phantoms containing aqueous solutions of [1-13 C] lactate (2.3&#160;M) and [13 C] urea (8&#160;M). Eight patients (mean age 67&#8201;&#177;&#8201;6&#8201;years) with biopsy-confirmed Gleason 3&#8201;+&#8201;4 (n&#160;=&#160;7) and 4&#8201;+&#8201;3 (n&#160;=&#160;1) PCa. FIELD STRENGTH\/SEQUENCES: 1 H MRI at 3&#160;T with T2 -weighted turbo spin-echo sequence used for spatial localization and spoiled dual gradient-echo sequence used for B0 -field measurement. ME-bSSFP sequence for 13 C MR spectroscopic imaging with retrospective multipoint IDEAL metabolite separation. The primary endpoint was the analysis of pyruvate-to-lactate conversion in PCa and healthy prostate regions of interest (ROIs) using model-free area under the curve (AUC) ratios and a one-directional kinetic model (kP ). The secondary objectives were to investigate the correlation between simulated and experimental ME-bSSFP metabolite signals for HP 13 C-MRI parameter optimization. Pearson correlation coefficients with 95% confidence intervals and paired t-tests. The level of statistical significance was set at P&#8201;<&#8201;0.05. Strong correlations between simulated and empirical ME-bSSFP signals were found (r&#8201;>&#8201;0.96). Therefore, the simulation framework was used for sequence optimization. Whole prostate metabolic HP 13 C-MRI, observing the conversion of pyruvate into lactate, with a temporal resolution of 6&#160;seconds was demonstrated using ME-bSSFP. Both assessed metrics resulted in significant differences between PCa (mean&#8201;&#177;&#8201;SD) (AUC&#160;=&#160;0.33&#8201;&#177;&#8201;012, kP &#160;=&#160;0.038&#8201;&#177;&#8201;0.014) and healthy (AUC&#160;=&#160;0.15&#8201;&#177;&#8201;0.10, kP &#160;=&#160;0.011&#8201;&#177;&#8201;0.007) ROIs.

HIV may also be a risk factor for the development of HPV-negative head and neck, liver, lung, and kidney cancer. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying HIV-1-associated increase of epithelial malignancies are not fully understood. Here, we showed that HPV-16-immortalized anal AKC-2 and cervical CaSki epithelial cells that undergo prolonged exposure to cell-free HIV-1 virions or HIV-1 viral proteins gp120 and tat respond with the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and increased invasiveness. Similar responses were observed in HPV-16-infected SCC-47 and HPV-16-negative HSC-3 oral epithelial cancer cells that were cultured with these viral proteins. EMT induced by gp120 and tat led to detachment of poorly adherent cells from the culture substratum; these cells remained capable of reattachment, upon which they coexpressed both E-cadherin and vimentin, indicative of an intermediate stage of EMT. The reattached cells also expressed stem cell markers CD133 and CD44, which may play a critical role in cancer cell invasion and metastasis. Inhibition of transforming growth factor (TGF)-&#946;1 and MAPK signaling and vimentin expression, and restoration of E-cadherin expression reduced HIV-induced EMT and the invasive activity of HPV-16-immortalized anal and cervical epithelial cells. Collectively, our results suggest that these approaches along with HIV viral suppression with antiretroviral therapy (ART) might be useful to limit the role of HIV-1 infection in the acceleration of HPV-associated or HPV-independent epithelial neoplasia. IMPORTANCE HPV-16-immortalized genital and oral epithelial cells and HPV-negative oral cancer cells that undergo prolonged contact with cell-free HIV-1 virions or with viral proteins gp120 and tat respond by becoming more invasive. EMT cells induced by HIV-1 in cultures of HPV-16-immortalized anal and cervical epithelial cells express the stem cell markers CD133 and CD44. These results suggest that the interaction of HIV-1 with neoplastic epithelial cells may lead to their de-differentiation into cancer stem cells that are resistant to apoptosis and anti-cancer drugs. Thus, this pathway may play a critical role in the development of invasive cancer. Inhibition of TGF-&#946;1 and MAPK signaling and vimentin expression, and restoration of E-cadherin expression reduced HIV-induced EMT and the invasiveness of HPV-16-immortalized anal and cervical epithelial cells. Taken together, these results suggest that these approaches might be exploited to limit the role of HIV-1 infection in the acceleration of HPV-associated or HPV-independent epithelial neoplasia.","query":"cancer"},"36314945":{"ArticleTitle":"HCV Infection Increases the Expression of ACE2 Receptor, Leading to Enhanced Entry of Both HCV and SARS-CoV-2 into Hepatocytes and a Coinfection State.","AbstractText":"Recent studies suggest the enhancement of liver injury in COVID-19 patients infected with Hepatitis C virus (HCV). Hepatocytes express low levels of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the SARS-CoV-2 entry receptor, raising the possibility of HCV-SARS-CoV-2 coinfection in the liver. This work aimed to explore whether HCV and SARS-CoV-2 coinfect hepatocytes and the interplay between these viruses. We demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 coinfects HCV-infected Huh7.5 (Huh7.5HCV) cells. Both viruses replicated efficiently in the coinfected cells, with HCV replication enhanced in coinfected compared to HCV-mono-infected cells. Strikingly, Huh7.5HCV cells were eight fold more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses than naive Huh7.5 cells, suggesting enhanced SARS-CoV-2 entry into HCV-preinfected hepatocytes. In addition, we observed increased binding of spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) protein to Huh7.5HCV cells, as well as enhanced cell-to-cell fusion of Huh7.5HCV cells with spike-expressing Huh7.5 cells. We explored the mechanism of enhanced SARS-CoV-2 entry and identified an increased ACE2 mRNA and protein levels in Huh7.5HCV cells, primary hepatocytes, and in data from infected liver biopsies obtained from database. Importantly, higher expression of ACE2 increased HCV infection by enhancing its binding to the host cell, underscoring its role in the HCV life cycle as well. Transcriptome analysis revealed that shared host signaling pathways were induced in HCV-SARS-CoV-2 coinfection. This study revealed complex interactions between HCV and SARS-CoV-2 infections in hepatocytes, which may lead to the increased liver damage recently reported in HCV-positive COVID-19 patients. IMPORTANCE Here, we provide the first experimental evidence for the coexistence of SARS-CoV-2 infection with HCV, and the interplay between them. The study revealed a complex relationship of enhancement between the two viruses, where HCV infection increased the expression of the SARS-CoV-2 entry receptor ACE2, thus facilitating SARS-CoV-2 entry, and potentially, also HCV entry. Thereafter, SARS-CoV-2 infection enhanced HCV replication in hepatocytes. This study may explain the aggravation of liver damage that was recently reported in COVID-19 patients with HCV coinfection and suggests preinfection with HCV as a risk factor for severe COVID-19. Moreover, it highlights the possible importance of HCV treatment for coinfected patients. In a broader view, these findings emphasize the importance of identifying coinfecting pathogens that increase the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and that may accelerate COVID-19-related co-morbidities.","query":"cancer"},"36314942":{"ArticleTitle":"Transient Systemic Autophagy Ablation Irreversibly Inhibits Lung Tumor Cell Metabolism and Promotes T-Cell Mediated Tumor Killing.","AbstractText":"Macroautophagy\/autophagy is a highly conserved catabolic process pivotal to cellular homeostasis and support of tumorigenesis. Being a potential therapeutic target for cancer, we have worked to understand the implications of autophagy inhibition both systemically, and tumor-specifically. We utilized inducible expression of Atg5 shRNA to temporally control autophagy levels in a reversible manner to study the effects of tumor-intrinsic and systemic autophagic loss and restoration on established KrasG12D\/+;trp53-\/- (KP) lung tumor growth. We reported that transient systemic ATG5 loss significantly reduces KP lung tumor growth. Through in vivo isotope tracing and metabolic flux analyses, we noted that systemic ATG5 knockdown significantly reduces the uptake of glucose and lactate in lung tumors, leading to impaired TCA cycle metabolism and biosynthesis. Additionally, we observed an increased tumor T cell infiltration in the absence of systemic ATG5, which is essential for T cell-mediated tumor killing. Moreover, the impaired tumor metabolism and increased T cell infiltration are sustained when autophagy is restored in a short term. Finally, we found that intermittent systemic ATG5 knockdown, a mock therapy situation, significantly prolongs the lifespan of mice bearing KP lung tumors. Our findings lay the proof of concept for inhibition of autophagy as a valid approach to cancer therapy.","query":"cancer"},"36314940":{"ArticleTitle":"Targeted Metabolomics and High-Throughput RNA Sequencing-Based Transcriptomics Reveal Massive Changes in the Streptomyces venezuelae NRRL B-65442 Metabolism Caused by Ethanol Shock.","AbstractText":"The species Streptomyces venezuelae is represented by several distinct strains with variable abilities to biosynthesize structurally diverse secondary metabolites. In this work, we examined the effect of ethanol shock on the transcriptome and metabolome of Streptomyces venezuelae NRRL B-65442 using high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and high-resolution liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS\/MS). Ethanol shock caused massive changes in the gene expression profile, differentially affecting genes for secondary metabolite biosynthesis and central metabolic pathways. Most of the data from the transcriptome analysis correlated well with the metabolome changes, including the overproduction of jadomycin congeners and a downshift in the production of desferrioxamines, legonoxamine, foroxymithin, and a small cryptic ribosomally synthesized peptide. Some of the metabolome changes, such as the overproduction of chloramphenicol, could not be explained by overexpression of the cognate biosynthetic genes but correlated with the expression profiles of genes for precursor biosynthesis. Changes in the transcriptome were also observed for several genes known to play a role in stress response in other bacteria and included at least 10 extracytoplasmic function &#963; factors. This study provides important new insights into the stress response in antibiotic-producing bacteria and will help to understand the complex mechanisms behind the environmental factor-induced regulation of secondary metabolite biosynthesis. IMPORTANCE Streptomyces spp. are filamentous Gram-positive bacteria known as versatile producers of secondary metabolites, of which some have been developed into human medicines against infections and cancer. The genomes of these bacteria harbor dozens of gene clusters governing the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites (BGCs), of which most are not expressed under laboratory conditions. Detailed knowledge of the complex regulation of BGC expression is still lacking, although certain growth conditions are known to trigger the production of previously undetected secondary metabolites. In this work, we investigated the effect of ethanol shock on the production of secondary metabolites by Streptomyces venezuelae and correlated these findings with the expression of cognate BGCs and primary metabolic pathways involved in the generation of cofactors and precursors. The findings of this study set the stage for the rational manipulation of bacterial genomes aimed at enhanced production of industrially important bioactive natural products.","query":"cancer"},"36314929":{"ArticleTitle":"Blood MALT1 deficiency is common and relates to unfavorable induction therapy response and survival profile in acute myeloid leukemia patients.","AbstractText":"Mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma translocation protein 1 (MALT1) regulates T helper\/regulatory T cell balance, autoimmunity development, and leukemia pathogenesis. As a result, this study aimed to investigate the clinical role of MALT1 in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML).

Moreover, MALT1 expressions were also determined in 50 disease controls (DCs) and 50 healthy controls (HCs). MALT1 expression was reduced in AML patients compared to HCs and DCs (both adjusted P&#8201;<&#8201;.001).

Both spheroids were highly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, and two representative anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents, remdesivir and 5h (an inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2's main protease), inhibited the infectivity and replication of SARS-CoV-2 in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting that these human-derived induced spheroids should serve as valuable target cells for the evaluation of anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity.
